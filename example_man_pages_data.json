That white list is\n            called a \"Kernel Module Interface white list\".  This is\n            because for the Kernel, we don't talk aboutABI; we rather\n            talk about the interface between the Kernel and its module.\n            Hence the termKMIrather thanABI.\n\n            Any other function or variable which ELF symbol are not\n            present in that white list will not be considered by this\n            tool.\n\n            If this option is not provided -- thus if no white list is\n            provided -- then the entire KMI, that is, the set of all\n            publicly defined and exported functions and global variables\n            by the Linux Kernel binaries, is considered.\n\n          \u2022--drop-private-typesThis option is to be used with the--headers-dir1,header-file1,header-file2and--headers-dir2options.  With\n            this option, types that areNOTdefined in the headers are\n            entirely dropped from the internal representation build by\n            Libabigail to represent the ABI.  They thus don't have to be\n            filtered out from the final ABI change report because they\n            are not even present in Libabigail's representation.\n\n            Without this option however, those private types are kept in\n            the internal representation and later filtered out from the\n            report.\n\n            This options thus potentially makes Libabigail consume less\n            memory.  It's meant to be mainly used to optimize the memory\n            consumption of the tool on binaries with a lot of publicly\n            defined and exported types.\n\n          \u2022--exported-interfaces-onlyBy default, when looking at the debug information\n            accompanying a binary, this tool analyzes the descriptions\n            of the types reachable by the interfaces (functions and\n            variables) that are visible outside of their translation\n            unit.  Once that analysis is done, an ABI corpus is\n            constructed by only considering the subset of types\n            reachable from interfaces associated toELFsymbols that are\n            defined and exported by the binary.  It's those final ABI\n            Corpora that are compared by this tool.\n\n            The problem with that approach however is that analyzing all\n            the interfaces that are visible from outside their\n            translation unit can amount to a lot of data, especially\n            when those binaries are applications, as opposed to shared\n            libraries.  One example of such applications is theLinuxKernel.  Analyzing massive ABI corpora like these can be\n            extremely slow.\n\n            To mitigate that performance issue, this option allows\n            libabigail to only analyze types that are reachable from\n            interfaces associated with defined and exportedELFsymbols.\n\n            Note that this option is turned on by default when analyzing\n            theLinux Kernel.  Otherwise, it's turned off by default.\n\n          \u2022--allow-non-exported-interfacesWhen looking at the debug information accompanying a binary,\n            this tool analyzes the descriptions of the types reachable\n            by the interfaces (functions and variables) that are visible\n            outside of their translation unit.  Once that analysis is\n            done, an ABI corpus is constructed by only considering the\n            subset of types reachable from interfaces associated toELFsymbols that are defined and exported by the binary.  It's\n            those final ABI Corpora that are compared by this tool.\n\n            The problem with that approach however is that analyzing all\n            the interfaces that are visible from outside their\n            translation unit can amount to a lot of data, especially\n            when those binaries are applications, as opposed to shared\n            libraries.  One example of such applications is theLinuxKernel.  Analyzing massive ABI Corpora like these can be\n            extremely slow.\n\n            In the presence of an \"average sized\" binary however one can\n            afford having libabigail analyze all interfaces that are\n            visible outside of their translation unit, using this\n            option.\n\n            Note that this option is turned on by default, unless we are\n            in the presence of theLinux Kernel.\n\n          \u2022--statRather than displaying the detailed ABI differences betweenfirst-shared-libraryandsecond-shared-library, just display\n            some summary statistics about these differences.\n\n          \u2022--symtabsOnly display the symbol tables of thefirst-shared-libraryandsecond-shared-library.\n\n          \u2022--deleted-fnsIn the resulting report about the differences betweenfirst-shared-libraryandsecond-shared-library, only display\n            the globally defined functions that got deleted fromfirst-shared-library.\n\n          \u2022--changed-fnsIn the resulting report about the differences betweenfirst-shared-libraryandsecond-shared-library, only display\n            the changes in sub-types of the global functions defined infirst-shared-library.\n\n          \u2022--added-fnsIn the resulting report about the differences betweenfirst-shared-libraryandsecond-shared-library, only display\n            the globally defined functions that were added tosecond-shared-library.\n\n          \u2022--deleted-varsIn the resulting report about the differences betweenfirst-shared-libraryandsecond-shared-library, only display\n            the globally defined variables that were deleted fromfirst-shared-library.\n\n          \u2022--changed-varsIn the resulting report about the differences betweenfirst-shared-libraryandsecond-shared-library, only display\n            the changes in the sub-types of the global variables defined\n            infirst-shared-library\u2022--added-varsIn the resulting report about the differences betweenfirst-shared-libraryandsecond-shared-library, only display\n            the global variables that were added (defined) tosecond-shared-library.\n\n          \u2022--non-reachable-types|-tAnalyze and emit change reports for all the types of the\n            binary, including those that are not reachable from global\n            functions and variables.\n\n            This option might incur some serious performance degradation\n            as the number of types analyzed can be huge.  However, if\n            paired with the--headers-dir{1,2}and/orheader-file{1,2}options, the additional non-reachable types analyzed are\n            restricted to those defined in public headers files, thus\n            hopefully making the performance hit acceptable.\n\n            Also, using this option alongside suppression specifications\n            (by also using the--suppressionsoption) might help keep\n            the number of analyzed types (and the potential performance\n            degradation) in control.\n\n            Note that without this option, only types that are reachable\n            from global functions and variables are analyzed, so the\n            tool detects and reports changes on these reachable types\n            only.\n\n          \u2022--no-added-symsIn the resulting report about the differences betweenfirst-shared-libraryandsecond-shared-library, do not\n            display added functions or variables.

This option implies--redundant.\n\n            The typical output of abidiff when comparing two binaries\n            looks like this\n\n                $ abidiff libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so\n                Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 1 Changed, 0 Added function\n                Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable\n\n                1 function with some indirect sub-type change:\n\n                  [C]'function void fn(C&)' at test-v1.cc:13:1 has some indirect sub-type changes:\n                    parameter 1 of type 'C&' has sub-type changes:\n                      in referenced type 'struct C' at test-v1.cc:7:1:\n                        type size hasn't changed\n                        1 data member change:\n                         type of 'leaf* C::m0' changed:\n                           in pointed to type 'struct leaf' at test-v1.cc:1:1:\n                             type size changed from 32 to 64 bits\n                             1 data member insertion:\n                               'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1\n\n                $\n\n            So in that example the report emits information about how\n            the data member insertion change of \"struct leaf\" is\n            reachable from function \"void fn(C&)\".  In other words, the\n            report not only shows the data member change on \"struct\n            leaf\", but it also shows the impact of that change on the\n            function \"void fn(C&)\".\n\n            In abidiff parlance, the change on \"struct leaf\" is called a\n            leaf change.  So the--leaf-changes-only--impacted-interfacesoptions show, well, only the leaf\n            change.  And it goes like this:\n\n                $ abidiff -l libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so\n                'struct leaf' changed:\n                  type size changed from 32 to 64 bits\n                  1 data member insertion:\n                    'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1\n\n                  one impacted interface:\n                    function void fn(C&)\n                $\n\n            Note how the report ends by showing the list of interfaces\n            impacted by the leaf change.\n\n            Now if you don't want to see that list of impacted\n            interfaces, then you can just avoid using the--impacted-interfaceoption.  You can learn about that\n            option below, in any case.\n\n          \u2022--impacted-interfacesWhen showing leaf changes, this option instructs abidiff to\n            show the list of impacted interfaces.  This option is thus\n            to be used in addition the--leaf-changes-onlyoption,\n            otherwise, it's ignored.\n\n          \u2022--dump-diff-treeAfter the diff report, emit a textual representation of\n              the diff nodes tree used by the comparison engine to\n              represent the changed functions and variables.  That\n              representation is emitted to the error output for\n              debugging purposes.  Note that this diff tree is relevant\n              only to functions and variables that have some sub-type\n              changes.  Added or removed functions and variables do not\n              have any diff nodes tree associated to them.\n\n          \u2022--no-assume-odr-for-cplusplusWhen analysing a binary originating from C++ code usingDWARFdebug information, libabigail assumes theOneDefinition Ruleto speed-up the analysis.  In that case,\n            when several types have the same name in the binary, they\n            are assumed to all be equal.\n\n            This option disables that assumption and instructs\n            libabigail to actually actually compare the types to\n            determine if they are equal.\n\n          \u2022--no-leverage-dwarf-factorizationWhen analysing a binary whichDWARFdebug information was\n            processed with theDWZtool, the type information is\n            supposed to be already factorized.  That context is used by\n            libabigail to perform some speed optimizations.\n\n            This option disables those optimizations.\n\n          \u2022--no-change-categorization | -xThis option disables the categorization of changes into\n            harmless and harmful changes.  Note that this categorization\n            is a pre-requisite for the filtering of changes so this\n            option disables that filtering.  The goal of this option is\n            to speed-up the execution of the program for cases where the\n            graph of changes is huge and where the user is just\n            interested in looking at, for instance, leaf node changes\n            without caring about their possible impact on interfaces.\n            In that case, this option would be used along with the--leaf-changes-onlyone.\n\n          \u2022--ctfWhen comparing binaries, extract ABI information fromCTFdebug information, if present.\n\n          \u2022--btfWhen comparing binaries, extract ABI information fromBTFdebug information, if present.\n\n          \u2022--statsEmit statistics about various internal things.\n\n          \u2022--verboseEmit verbose logs about the progress of miscellaneous\n            internal things.",

The emitted KMI includes all the globally\n       defined functions and variables, along with a complete\n       representation of their types.\n\n       To generate either ABI or KMI representation, by defaultabidwuses debug information in theDWARFformat, if present, otherwise\n       it looks for debug information inCTForBTFformats, if present.\n       Finally, if no debug info in these formats is found, it only\n       considersELFsymbols and report about their addition or removal.\n\n       This tool uses the libabigail library to analyze the binary as\n       well as its associated debug information.  Here is its general\n       mode of operation.\n\n       When instructed to do so, a binary and its associated debug\n       information is read and analyzed.  To that effect, libabigail\n       analyzes by default the descriptions of the types reachable by\n       the interfaces (functions and variables) that are visible outside\n       of their translation unit.  Once that analysis is done, an\n       Application Binary Interface Corpus is constructed by only\n       considering the subset of types reachable from interfaces\n       associated toELFsymbols that are defined and exported by the\n       binary.  It's that final ABI corpus which libabigail considers as\n       representing the ABI of the analyzed binary.\n\n       Libabigail then has capabilities to generate textual\n       representations of ABI Corpora, compare them, analyze their\n       changes and report about them.",

So it only reads the ELF and\n            debug information, builds the internal representation of the\n            ABI and exits.

With this option, types that areNOTdefined in the headers are entirely dropped from the\n            internal representation build by Libabigail to represent the\n            ABI and will not end up in the abi XML file.\n\n          \u2022--no-elf-neededDo not include the list of DT_NEEDED dependency names in the\n            corpus.\n\n          \u2022--drop-undefined-symsWith this option functions or variables for which the\n            (exported) ELF symbol is undefined are dropped from the\n            internal representation build by Libabigail to represent the\n            ABI and will not end up in the abi XML file.\n\n          \u2022--exported-interfaces-onlyBy default, when looking at the debug information\n            accompanying a binary, this tool analyzes the descriptions\n            of the types reachable by the interfaces (functions and\n            variables) that are visible outside of their translation\n            unit.  Once that analysis is done, an ABI corpus is\n            constructed by only considering the subset of types\n            reachable from interfaces associated toELFsymbols that are\n            defined and exported by the binary.  It's that final ABI\n            corpus which textual representation is saved asABIXML.\n\n            The problem with that approach however is that analyzing all\n            the interfaces that are visible from outside their\n            translation unit can amount to a lot of data, especially\n            when those binaries are applications, as opposed to shared\n            libraries.  One example of such applications is theLinuxKernel.  Analyzing massive ABI corpora like these can be\n            extremely slow.\n\n            To mitigate that performance issue, this option allows\n            libabigail to only analyze types that are reachable from\n            interfaces associated with defined and exportedELFsymbols.\n\n            Note that this option is turned on by default when analyzing\n            theLinux Kernel.  Otherwise, it's turned off by default.\n\n          \u2022--allow-non-exported-interfacesWhen looking at the debug information accompanying a binary,\n            this tool analyzes the descriptions of the types reachable\n            by the interfaces (functions and variables) that are visible\n            outside of their translation unit.  Once that analysis is\n            done, an ABI corpus is constructed by only considering the\n            subset of types reachable from interfaces associated toELFsymbols that are defined and exported by the binary.  It's\n            that final ABI corpus which textual representation is saved\n            asABIXML.\n\n            The problem with that approach however is that analyzing all\n            the interfaces that are visible from outside their\n            translation unit can amount to a lot of data, especially\n            when those binaries are applications, as opposed to shared\n            libraries.  One example of such applications is theLinuxKernel.  Analyzing massive ABI corpora like these can be\n            extremely slow.\n\n            In the presence of an \"average sized\" binary however one can\n            afford having libabigail analyze all interfaces that are\n            visible outside of their translation unit, using this\n            option.\n\n            Note that this option is turned on by default, unless we are\n            in the presence of theLinux Kernel.\n\n          \u2022--no-linux-kernel-modeWithout this option, if abipkgiff detects that the binaries\n            it is looking at are Linux Kernel binaries (either vmlinux\n            or modules) then it only considers functions and variables\n            which ELF symbols are listed in the __ksymtab and\n            __ksymtab_gpl sections.\n\n            With this option, abipkgdiff considers the binary as a\n            non-special ELF binary.  It thus considers functions and\n            variables which are defined and exported in the ELF sense.\n\n          \u2022--check-alternate-debug-info<elf-path>\n\n            If the debug info for the fileelf-pathcontains a reference\n            to analternate debug infofile,abidwchecks that it can\n            find that alternate debug info file.  In that case, it emits\n            a meaningful success message mentioning the full path to the\n            alternate debug info file found.  Otherwise, it emits an\n            error code.\n\n          \u2022--no-show-locsIn the emitted ABI representation, do not show file, line\n              or column where ABI artifacts are defined.\n\n          \u2022--no-parameter-namesIn the emitted ABI representation, do not show names of\n            function parameters, just the types.\n\n          \u2022--no-write-default-sizesIn the XML ABI representation, do not write the size-in-bits\n            for pointer type definitions, reference type definitions,\n            function declarations and function types when they are equal\n            to the default address size of the translation unit.  Note\n            that libabigail before 1.8 will not set the default size and\n            will interpret types without a size-in-bits attribute as\n            zero sized.\n\n          \u2022--type-id-style<sequence``|``hash>\n\n            This option controls how types are idenfied in the generated\n            XML files.  The defaultsequencestyle just numbers (withtype-id-as prefix) the types in the order they are\n            encountered.  Thehashstyle uses a (stable, portable) hash\n            of libabigail's internal type names and is intended to make\n            the XML files easier to diff.\n\n          \u2022--check-alternate-debug-info-base-name<elf-path>\n\n            Like--check-alternate-debug-info, but in the success\n            message, only mention the base name of the debug info file;\n            not its full path.\n\n          \u2022--load-all-typesBy default,libabigail(and thusabidw) only loads types\n            that are reachable from functions and variables declarations\n            that are publicly defined and exported by the binary.  So\n            only those types are present in the output ofabidw.  This\n            option however makesabidwloadallthe types defined in the\n            binaries, even those that are not reachable from public\n            declarations.\n\n            \u2022--no-load-undefined-interfacesBy default,libabigail(and thusabidw) loads information\n            about undefined function and variable symbols as well as\n            functions and variables that are associated with those\n            undefined symbols.  Those are called undefined interfaces.\n            This option however makes makesabidwavoid loading\n            information about undefined interfaces.  The resulting XML\n            file thus doesn't contain information about those undefined\n            interfaces.\n\n          \u2022--abidiffLoad the ABI of the ELF binary given in argument, save it\n              in libabigail's XML format in a temporary file; read the\n              ABI from the temporary XML file and compare the ABI that\n              has been read back against the ABI of the ELF binary given\n              in argument.  The ABIs should compare equal.  If they\n              don't, the program emits a diagnostic and exits with a\n              non-zero code.\n\n              This is a debugging and sanity check option.\n\n              \u2022--debug-abidiffSame as--abidiffbut in debug mode.  In this mode, error\n              messages are emitted for types which fail type\n              canonicalization.\n\n              This is an optional debugging and sanity check option.  To\n              enable it the libabigail package needs to be configured\n              with the --enable-debug-self-comparison option.\n\n              \u2022--debug-type-canonicalization | --debug-tcDebug the type canonicalization process.  This is done by\n              using structural and canonical equality when\n              canonicalizing every single type.  Structural and\n              canonical equality should yield the same result.  If they\n              don't yield the same result for a given type, then it\n              means that the canonicalization of that type went wrong.\n              In that case, an error message is emitted and the\n              execution of the program is aborted.\n\n              This option is available only if the package was\n              configured with the --enable-debug-type-canonicalization\n              option.\n\n          \u2022--no-assume-odr-for-cplusplusWhen analysing a binary originating from C++ code usingDWARFdebug information, libabigail assumes theOneDefinition Ruleto speed-up the analysis.  In that case,\n            when several types have the same name in the binary, they\n            are assumed to all be equal.\n\n            This option disables that assumption and instructs\n            libabigail to actually actually compare the types to\n            determine if they are equal.\n\n          \u2022--no-leverage-dwarf-factorizationWhen analysing a binary whichDWARFdebug information was\n            processed with theDWZtool, the type information is\n            supposed to be already factorized.

The\n       software package formats currently supported areDeb,RPM,tararchives (either compressed or not) and plain directories that\n       contain binaries.\n\n       For a comprehensive ABI change report that includes changes about\n       function and variable sub-types, the two input packages must be\n       accompanied with their debug information packages that contain\n       debug information either inDWARF,CTFor inBTFformats.  Please\n       note however that some packages contain binaries that embed the\n       debug information directly in a section of said binaries.  In\n       those cases, obviously, no separate debug information package is\n       needed as the tool will find the debug information inside the\n       binaries.\n\n       By default,abipkgdiffuses debug information inDWARFformat, if\n       present, otherwise it compares binaries interfaces using debug\n       information inCTFor inBTFformats, if present. Finally, if no\n       debug info in these formats is found, it only considersELFsymbols and report about their addition or removal.\n\n       This tool uses the libabigail library to analyze the binary as\n       well as its associated debug information.  Here is its general\n       mode of operation.\n\n       When instructed to do so, a binary and its associated debug\n       information is read and analyzed.  To that effect, libabigail\n       analyzes by default the descriptions of the types reachable by\n       the interfaces (functions and variables) that are visible outside\n       of their translation unit.  Once that analysis is done, an\n       Application Binary Interface Corpus is constructed by only\n       considering the subset of types reachable from interfaces\n       associated toELFsymbols that are defined and exported by the\n       binary.  It's that final ABI corpus which libabigail considers as\n       representing the ABI of the analyzed binary.\n\n       Libabigail then has capabilities to generate textual\n       representations of ABI Corpora, compare them, analyze their\n       changes and report about them.",

This option implies--redundantThe typical output ofabipkgdiffandabidiffwhen comparing\n            two binaries, that we shall callfull impact report, looks\n            like this\n\n                $ abidiff libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so\n                Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 1 Changed, 0 Added function\n                Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable\n\n                1 function with some indirect sub-type change:\n\n                  [C]'function void fn(C&)' at test-v1.cc:13:1 has some indirect sub-type changes:\n                    parameter 1 of type 'C&' has sub-type changes:\n                      in referenced type 'struct C' at test-v1.cc:7:1:\n                        type size hasn't changed\n                        1 data member change:\n                         type of 'leaf* C::m0' changed:\n                           in pointed to type 'struct leaf' at test-v1.cc:1:1:\n                             type size changed from 32 to 64 bits\n                             1 data member insertion:\n                               'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1\n\n                $\n\n            So in that example the report emits information about how\n            the data member insertion change of \"struct leaf\" is\n            reachable from function \"void fn(C&)\".  In other words, the\n            report not only shows the data member change on \"struct\n            leaf\", but it also shows the impact of that change on the\n            function \"void fn(C&)\".\n\n            In abidiff (and abipkgdiff) parlance, the change on \"struct\n            leaf\" is called a leaf change.  So the--leaf-changes-only--impacted-interfacesoptions show, well, only the leaf\n            change.  And it goes like this:\n\n                $ abidiff -l libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so\n                'struct leaf' changed:\n                  type size changed from 32 to 64 bits\n                  1 data member insertion:\n                    'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1\n\n                  one impacted interface:\n                    function void fn(C&)\n                $\n\n            Note how the report ends up by showing the list of\n            interfaces impacted by the leaf change.  That's the effect\n            of the additional--impacted-interfacesoption.\n\n            Now if you don't want to see that list of impacted\n            interfaces, then you can just avoid using the--impacted-interfaceoption.  You can learn about that\n            option below, in any case.\n\n            Please note that when comparing two Linux Kernel packages,\n            it's thisleaf changes reportthat is emitted, by default.\n            The normal so-calledfull impact reportcan be emitted with\n            the option--full-impactwhich is documented later below.\n\n          \u2022--impacted-interfacesWhen showing leaf changes, this option instructs abipkgdiff\n            to show the list of impacted interfaces.  This option is\n            thus to be used in addition to the--leaf-changes-onlyoption, or, when comparing two Linux Kernel packages.\n            Otherwise, it's simply ignored.\n\n          \u2022--full-impact|-fWhen comparing two Linux Kernel packages, this function\n            instructsabipkgdiffto emit the so-calledfull impactreport, which is the default report kind emitted by theabidifftool:\n\n                $ abidiff libtest-v0.so libtest-v1.so\n                Functions changes summary: 0 Removed, 1 Changed, 0 Added function\n                Variables changes summary: 0 Removed, 0 Changed, 0 Added variable\n\n                1 function with some indirect sub-type change:\n\n                  [C]'function void fn(C&)' at test-v1.cc:13:1 has some indirect sub-type changes:\n                    parameter 1 of type 'C&' has sub-type changes:\n                      in referenced type 'struct C' at test-v1.cc:7:1:\n                        type size hasn't changed\n                        1 data member change:\n                         type of 'leaf* C::m0' changed:\n                           in pointed to type 'struct leaf' at test-v1.cc:1:1:\n                             type size changed from 32 to 64 bits\n                             1 data member insertion:\n                               'char leaf::m1', at offset 32 (in bits) at test-v1.cc:4:1\n\n                $\n\n          \u2022--non-reachable-types|-tAnalyze and emit change reports for all the types of the\n            binary, including those that are not reachable from global\n            functions and variables.\n\n            This option might incur some serious performance degradation\n            as the number of types analyzed can be huge.  However, if\n            paired with the--devel-pkg{1,2}options, the additional\n            non-reachable types analyzed are restricted to those defined\n            in the public headers files carried by the referenced\n            development packages, thus hopefully making the performance\n            hit acceptable.\n\n            Also, using this option alongside suppression specifications\n            (by also using the--suppressionsoption) might help keep\n            the number of analyzed types (and the potential performance\n            degradation) in control.\n\n            Note that without this option, only types that are reachable\n            from global functions and variables are analyzed, so the\n            tool detects and reports changes on these reachable types\n            only.\n\n          \u2022--exported-interfaces-onlyBy default, when looking at the debug information\n            accompanying a binary, this tool analyzes the descriptions\n            of the types reachable by the interfaces (functions and\n            variables) that are visible outside of their translation\n            unit.  Once that analysis is done, an ABI corpus is\n            constructed by only considering the subset of types\n            reachable from interfaces associated toELFsymbols that are\n            defined and exported by the binary.  It's those final ABI\n            Corpora that are compared by this tool.\n\n            The problem with that approach however is that analyzing all\n            the interfaces that are visible from outside their\n            translation unit can amount to a lot of data, especially\n            when those binaries are applications, as opposed to shared\n            libraries.  One example of such applications is theLinuxKernel.  Analyzing massive ABI corpora like these can be\n            extremely slow.\n\n            To mitigate that performance issue, this option allows\n            libabigail to only analyze types that are reachable from\n            interfaces associated with defined and exportedELFsymbols.\n\n            Note that this option is turned on by default when analyzing\n            theLinux Kernel.

In that case,\n            when several types have the same name in the binary, they\n            are assumed to all be equal.\n\n            This option disables that assumption and instructs\n            libabigail to actually actually compare the types to\n            determine if they are equal.\n\n          \u2022--no-leverage-dwarf-factorizationWhen analysing a binary whichDWARFdebug information was\n            processed with theDWZtool, the type information is\n            supposed to be already factorized.

The default is the filea.out.  The section in the\n       relocatable object to use is specified with the-joption.addr2linehas two modes of operation.\n\n       In the first, hexadecimal addresses or symbol+offset are\n       specified on the command line, andaddr2linedisplays the file\n       name and line number for each address.\n\n       In the second,addr2linereads hexadecimal addresses or\n       symbol+offset from standard input, and prints the file name and\n       line number for each address on standard output.  In this mode,addr2linemay be used in a pipe to convert dynamically chosen\n       addresses.\n\n       The format of the output isFILENAME:LINENO.

One or two extra lines (if the-foption is used) are displayed for each inlined function.\n\n       Alternatively if the-poption is used then each input address\n       generates a single, long, output line containing the address, the\n       function name, the file name and the line number.

Once\n       created, this index is updated in the archive wheneverarmakes a\n       change to its contents (save for thequpdate operation).  An\n       archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library, and\n       allows routines in the library to call each other without regard\n       to their placement in the archive.\n\n       You may usenm -sornm --print-armapto list this index table.\n       If an archive lacks the table, another form ofarcalledranlibcan be used to add just the table.\n\n       GNUarcan optionally create athinarchive, which contains a\n       symbol index and references to the original copies of the member\n       files of the archive.  This is useful for building libraries for\n       use within a local build tree, where the relocatable objects are\n       expected to remain available, and copying the contents of each\n       object would only waste time and space.\n\n       An archive can either bethinor it can be normal.  It cannot be\n       both at the same time.  Once an archive is created its format\n       cannot be changed without first deleting it and then creating a\n       new archive in its place.\n\n       Thin archives are alsoflattened, so that adding one thin archive\n       to another thin archive does not nest it, as would happen with a\n       normal archive.  Instead the elements of the first archive are\n       added individually to the second archive.\n\n       The paths to the elements of the archive are stored relative to\n       the archive itself.\n\n       GNUaris designed to be compatible with two different\n       facilities.

If\n           you use the modifierb, the name of an existing archive\n           member must be present as therelposargument, before thearchivespecification.  (same asi).cCreatethe archive.  The specifiedarchiveis always created\n           if it did not exist, when you request an update.  But a\n           warning is issued unless you specify in advance that you\n           expect to create it, by using this modifier.DOperate indeterministicmode.  When adding files and the\n           archive index use zero for UIDs, GIDs, timestamps, and use\n           consistent file modes for all files.  When this option is\n           used, ifaris used with identical options and identical\n           input files, multiple runs will create identical output files\n           regardless of the input files' owners, groups, file modes, or\n           modification times.\n\n           Ifbinutilswas configured with--enable-deterministic-archives, then this mode is on by\n           default.  It can be disabled with theUmodifier, below.fTruncate names in the archive.  GNUarwill normally permit\n           file names of any length.  This will cause it to create\n           archives which are not compatible with the nativearprogram\n           on some systems.  If this is a concern, thefmodifier may be\n           used to truncate file names when putting them in the archive.iInsert new filesbeforean existing member of the archive.\n           If you use the modifieri, the name of an existing archive\n           member must be present as therelposargument, before thearchivespecification.  (same asb).lSpecify dependencies of this library.  The dependencies must\n           immediately follow this option character, must use the same\n           syntax as the linker command line, and must be specified\n           within a single argument.  I.e., if multiple items are\n           needed, they must be quoted to form a single command line\n           argument.  For exampleL \"-L/usr/local/lib -lmydep1 -lmydep2\"NUses thecountparameter.  This is used if there are multiple\n           entries in the archive with the same name.  Extract or delete\n           instancecountof the given name from the archive.oPreserve theoriginaldates of members when extracting them.\n           If you do not specify this modifier, files extracted from the\n           archive are stamped with the time of extraction.ODisplay member offsets inside the archive. Use together with\n           thetoption.PUse the full path name when matching or storing names in the\n           archive.  Archives created with full path names are not POSIX\n           compliant, and thus may not work with tools other than up to\n           date GNU tools.  Modifying such archives with GNUarwithout\n           usingPwill remove the full path names unless the archive is\n           a thin archive.  Note thatPmay be useful when adding files\n           to a thin archive sincerwithoutPignores the path when\n           choosing which element to replace.  Thus\n\n                   ar rcST archive.a subdir/file1 subdir/file2 file1\n\n           will result in the first \"subdir/file1\" being replaced with\n           \"file1\" from the current directory.  AddingPwill prevent\n           this replacement.sWrite an object-file index into the archive, or update an\n           existing one, even if no other change is made to the archive.\n           You may use this modifier flag either with any operation, or\n           alone.  Runningar son an archive is equivalent to runningranlibon it.SDo not generate an archive symbol table.  This can speed up\n           building a large library in several steps.  The resulting\n           archive can not be used with the linker.  In order to build a\n           symbol table, you must omit theSmodifier on the last\n           execution ofar, or you must runranlibon the archive.TDeprecated alias for--thin.Tis not recommended because in\n           many ar implementationsThas a different meaning, as\n           specified by X/Open System Interface.uNormally,ar r... inserts all files listed into the archive.\n           If you would like to insertonlythose of the files you list\n           that are newer than existing members of the same names, use\n           this modifier.  Theumodifier is allowed only for the\n           operationr(replace).  In particular, the combinationquis\n           not allowed, since checking the timestamps would lose any\n           speed advantage from the operationq.\n\n           Note - if an archive has been created in a deterministic\n           manner, eg via the use of theDmodifier, then replacement\n           will always happen and theumodifier will be ineffective.UDonotoperate indeterministicmode.  This is the inverse of\n           theDmodifier, above: added files and the archive index will\n           get their actual UID, GID, timestamp, and file mode values.\n\n           This is the default unlessbinutilswas configured with--enable-deterministic-archives.vThis modifier requests theverboseversion of an operation.\n           Many operations display additional information, such as\n           filenames processed, when the modifiervis appended.VThis modifier shows the version number ofar.\n\n       Thearprogram also supports some command-line options which are\n       neither modifiers nor actions, but which do change its behaviour\n       in specific ways:--helpDisplays the list of command-line options supported byarand\n           then exits.--versionDisplays the version information ofarand then exits.-X32_64arignores an initial option spelled-X32_64, for\n           compatibility with AIX.  The behaviour produced by this\n           option is the default for GNUar.ardoes not support any of\n           the other-Xoptions; in particular, it does not support-X32which is the default for AIXar.--pluginnameThe optional command-line switch--pluginnamecausesarto\n           load the plugin callednamewhich adds support for more file\n           formats, including object files with link-time optimization\n           information.\n\n           This option is only available if the toolchain has been built\n           with plugin support enabled.\n\n           If--pluginis not provided, but plugin support has been\n           enabled thenariterates over the files in${libdir}/bfd-pluginsin alphabetic order and the first\n           plugin that claims the object in question is used.\n\n           Please note that this plugin search directory isnotthe one\n           used byld's-pluginoption.  In order to makearuse the\n           linker plugin it must be copied into the${libdir}/bfd-pluginsdirectory.  For GCC based compilations\n           the linker plugin is calledliblto_plugin.so.0.0.0.  For\n           Clang based compilations it is calledLLVMgold.so.  The GCC\n           plugin is always backwards compatible with earlier versions,\n           so it is sufficient to just copy the newest one.--targettargetThe optional command-line switch--targetbfdnamespecifies\n           that the archive members are in an object code format\n           different from your system's default format.  See--outputdirnameThe--outputoption can be used to specify a path to a\n           directory into which archive members should be extracted.  If\n           this option is not specified then the current directory will\n           be used.\n\n           Note - although the presence of this option does imply axextraction operation that option must still be included on\n           the command line.--record-libdepslibdepsThe--record-libdepsoption is identical to thelmodifier,\n           just handled in long form.--thinMake the specifiedarchiveathinarchive.  If it already\n           exists and is a regular archive, the existing members must be\n           present in the same directory asarchive.@fileRead command-line options fromfile.  The options read are\n           inserted in place of the original @fileoption.  Iffiledoes\n           not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated\n           literally, and not removed.\n\n           Options infileare separated by whitespace.  A whitespace\n           character may be included in an option by surrounding the\n           entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any\n           character (including a backslash) may be included by\n           prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.

Once an archive has been created, new\n       files can be added, and existing files in an archive can be\n       extracted, deleted, or replaced. When an archive consists\n       entirely of valid object files, the implementation shall format\n       the archive so that it is usable as a library for link editing\n       (seec99andfort77).  When some of the archived files are not\n       valid object files, the suitability of the archive for library\n       use is undefined.  If an archive consists entirely of printable\n       files, the entire archive shall be printable.\n\n       Whenarcreates an archive, it creates administrative information\n       indicating whether a symbol table is present in the archive. When\n       there is at least one object file thatarrecognizes as such in\n       the archive, an archive symbol table shall be created in the\n       archive and maintained byar; it is used by the link editor to\n       search the archive.

        "rationale": "The archive format is not described. It is recognized that there\n       are several knownarformats, which are not compatible. Thearutility is included, however, to allow creation of archives that\n       are intended for use only on one machine. The archive is\n       specified as a file, and it can be moved as a file. This does\n       allow an archive to be moved from one machine to another machine\n       that uses the same implementation ofar.\n\n       Utilities such aspax(and its forebearstarandcpio) also\n       provide portable ``archives''. This is a not a duplication; thearutility is included to provide an interface primarily formakeand the compilers, based on a historical model.\n\n       In historical implementations, the-qoption (available on XSI-\n       conforming systems) is known to execute quickly becauseardoes\n       not check on whether the added members are already in the\n       archive. This is useful to bypass the searching otherwise done\n       when creating a large archive piece-by-piece. These remarks may\n       but need not remain true for a brand new implementation of this\n       utility; hence, these remarks have been moved into the RATIONALE.\n\n       BSD implementations historically required applications to provide\n       the-soption whenever the archive was supposed to contain a\n       symbol table.  As in this volume of POSIX.1\u20102017, System V\n       historically creates or updates an archive symbol table whenever\n       an object file is removed from, added to, or updated in the\n       archive.\n\n       The OPERANDS section requires what might seem to be true without\n       specifying it: the archive cannot truncate the filenames below\n       {NAME_MAX}.  Some historical implementations do so, however,\n       causing unexpected results for the application. Therefore, this\n       volume of POSIX.1\u20102017 makes the requirement explicit to avoid\n       misunderstandings.\n\n       According to the System V documentation, the options-dmpqrtxare\n       not required to begin with a <hyphen-minus> ('-').  This volume\n       of POSIX.1\u20102017 requires that a conforming application use the\n       leading <hyphen-minus>.\n\n       The archive format used by the 4.4 BSD implementation is\n       documented in this RATIONALE as an example:\n\n              A file created byarbegins with the ``magic'' string\"!<arch>\\n\".  The rest of the archive is made up of\n              objects, each of which is composed of a header for a file,\n              a possible filename, and the file contents. The header is\n              portable between machine architectures, and, if the file\n              contents are printable, the archive is itself printable.\n\n              The header is made up of six ASCII fields, followed by a\n              two-character trailer. The fields are the object name (16\n              characters), the file last modification time (12\n              characters), the user and group IDs (each 6 characters),\n              the file mode (8 characters), and the file size (10\n              characters). All numeric fields are in decimal, except for\n              the file mode, which is in octal.\n\n              The modification time is the filest_mtimefield. The user\n              and group IDs are the filest_uidandst_gidfields. The\n              file mode is the filest_modefield. The file size is the\n              filest_sizefield. The two-byte trailer is the string\"`<newline>\".\n\n              Only the name field has any provision for overflow. If any\n              filename is more than 16 characters in length or contains\n              an embedded space, the string\"#1/\"followed by the ASCII\n              length of the name is written in the name field.  The file\n              size (stored in the archive header) is incremented by the\n              length of the name. The name is then written immediately\n              following the archive header.\n\n              Any unused characters in any of these fields are written\n              as <space> characters. If any fields are their particular\n              maximum number of characters in length, there is no\n              separation between the fields.\n\n              Objects in the archive are always an even number of bytes\n              long; files that are an odd number of bytes long are\n              padded with a <newline>, although the size in the header\n              does not reflect this.\n\n       Thearutility description requires that (when all its members\n       are valid object files)arproduce an object code library, which\n       the linkage editor can use to extract object modules. If the\n       linkage editor needs a symbol table to permit random access to\n       the archive,armust provide it; however,ardoes not require a\n       symbol table.\n\n       The BSD-ooption was omitted. It is a rare conforming\n       application that usesarto extract object code from a library\n       with concern for its modification time, since this can only be of\n       importance tomake.  Hence, since this functionality is not\n       deemed important for applications portability, the modification\n       time of the extracted files is set to the current time.\n\n       There is at least one known implementation (for a small computer)\n       that can accommodate only object files for that system,\n       disallowing mixed object and other files. The ability to handle\n       any type of file is not only historical practice for most\n       implementations, but is also a reasonable expectation.\n\n       Consideration was given to changing the output format ofar-tvto the same format as the output ofls-l.  This would have made\n       parsing the output ofarthe same as that ofls.  This was\n       rejected in part because the currentarformat is commonly used\n       and changes would break historical usage.  Second,argives the\n       user ID and group ID in numeric format separated by a <slash>.\n       Changing this to be the user name and group name would not be\n       correct if the archive were moved to a machine that contained a\n       different user database. Sincearcannot know whether the archive\n       was generated on the same machine, it cannot tell what to report.\n\n       The text on the-uroption combination is historical practice\u2014\n       since one filename can easily represent two different files (for\n       example,/a/fooand/b/foo), it is reasonable to replace the file\n       in the archive even when the modification time in the archive is\n       identical to that in the file system.",

If you use (or have\n       used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you should find a\n       fairly similar environment when you use it on another\n       architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others,\n       including object file formats, most assembler directives (often\n       calledpseudo-ops) and assembler syntax.asis primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C\n       compiler \"gcc\" for use by the linker \"ld\".  Nevertheless, we've\n       tried to makeasassemble correctly everything that other\n       assemblers for the same machine would assemble.  Any exceptions\n       are documented explicitly.  This doesn't meanasalways uses the\n       same syntax as another assembler for the same architecture; for\n       example, we know of several incompatible versions of 680x0\n       assembly language syntax.\n\n       Each time you runasit assembles exactly one source program.\n       The source program is made up of one or more files.  (The\n       standard input is also a file.)\n\n       You giveasa command line that has zero or more input file\n       names.  The input files are read (from left file name to right).\n       A command-line argument (in any position) that has no special\n       meaning is taken to be an input file name.\n\n       If you giveasno file names it attempts to read one input file\n       from theasstandard input, which is normally your terminal.  You\n       may have to typectl-Dto tellasthere is no more program to\n       assemble.\n\n       Use--if you need to explicitly name the standard input file in\n       your command line.\n\n       If the source is empty,asproduces a small, empty object file.asmay write warnings and error messages to the standard error\n       file (usually your terminal).  This should not happen when  a\n       compiler runsasautomatically.  Warnings report an assumption\n       made so thatascould keep assembling a flawed program; errors\n       report a grave problem that stops the assembly.\n\n       If you are invokingasvia the GNU C compiler, you can use the-Waoption to pass arguments through to the assembler.  The\n       assembler arguments must be separated from each other (and the-Wa) by commas.  For example:\n\n               gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c\n\n       This passes two options to the assembler:-alh(emit a listing to\n       standard output with high-level and assembly source) and-L(retain local symbols in the symbol table).\n\n       Usually you do not need to use this-Wamechanism, since many\n       compiler command-line options are automatically passed to the\n       assembler by the compiler.  (You can call the GNU compiler driver\n       with the-voption to see precisely what options it passes to\n       each compilation pass, including the assembler.)",

The default (which can be restored by using theallowargument) is to allow such characters without\n           complaint.  Using thewarnargument will make the assembler\n           generate a warning message whenever any multibyte character\n           is encountered.  Using thewarn-sym-onlyargument will only\n           cause a warning to be generated when a symbol is defined with\n           a name that contains multibyte characters.  (References to\n           undefined symbols will not generate a warning).--no-pad-sectionsStop the assembler for padding the ends of output sections to\n           the alignment of that section.  The default is to pad the\n           sections, but this can waste space which might be needed on\n           targets which have tight memory constraints.-oobjfileName the object-file output fromasobjfile.-RFold the data section into the text section.--reduce-memory-overheadsIgnored.  Supported for compatibility with tools that apss\n           the same option to both the assembler and the linker.--scfi=experimentalThis option controls whether the assembler should synthesize\n           CFI for hand-written input.  If the input already contains\n           some synthesizable CFI directives, the assembler ignores them\n           and emits a warning.  Note that \"--scfi=experimental\" is not\n           intended to be used for compiler-generated code, including\n           inline assembly.  This experimental support is work in\n           progress.  Only System V AMD64 ABI is supported.\n\n           Each input function in assembly must begin with the \".type\"\n           directive, and should ideally be closed off using a \".size\"\n           directive.  When using SCFI, each \".type\" directive prompts\n           GAS to start a new FDE (a.k.a., Function Descriptor Entry).\n           This implies that with each \".type\" directive, a previous\n           block of instructions, if any, is finalised as a distinct\n           FDE.--sectname-substHonor substitution sequences in section names.--size-check=error--size-check=warningIssue an error or warning for invalid ELF .size directive.--statisticsPrint the maximum space (in bytes) and total time (in\n           seconds) used by assembly.--strip-local-absoluteRemove local absolute symbols from the outgoing symbol table.-v-versionPrint theasversion.--versionPrint theasversion and exit.-W--no-warnSuppress warning messages.--fatal-warningsTreat warnings as errors.--warnDon't suppress warning messages or treat them as errors.-wIgnored.-xIgnored.-ZGenerate an object file even after errors.-- |files...Standard input, or source files to assemble.\n\n       The following options are available when as is configured for the\n       64-bit mode of the ARM Architecture (AArch64).-EBThis option specifies that the output generated by the\n           assembler should be marked as being encoded for a big-endian\n           processor.-ELThis option specifies that the output generated by the\n           assembler should be marked as being encoded for a little-\n           endian processor.-mabi=abiSpecify which ABI the source code uses.  The recognized\n           arguments are: \"ilp32\" and \"lp64\", which decides the\n           generated object file in ELF32 and ELF64 format respectively.\n           The default is \"lp64\".-mcpu=processor[+extension...]This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler\n           will issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble\n           an instruction which will not execute on the target\n           processor.  The following processor names are recognized:\n           \"cortex-a34\", \"cortex-a35\", \"cortex-a53\", \"cortex-a55\",\n           \"cortex-a57\", \"cortex-a65\", \"cortex-a65ae\", \"cortex-a72\",\n           \"cortex-a73\", \"cortex-a75\", \"cortex-a76\", \"cortex-a76ae\",\n           \"cortex-a77\", \"cortex-a78\", \"cortex-a78ae\", \"cortex-a78c\",\n           \"cortex-a510\", \"cortex-a520\", \"cortex-a710\", \"cortex-a720\",\n           \"ares\", \"exynos-m1\", \"falkor\", \"neoverse-n1\", \"neoverse-n2\",\n           \"neoverse-e1\", \"neoverse-v1\", \"qdf24xx\", \"saphira\",\n           \"thunderx\", \"vulcan\", \"xgene1\" \"xgene2\", \"cortex-r82\",\n           \"cortex-x1\", \"cortex-x2\", \"cortex-x3\", and \"cortex-x4\".  The\n           special name \"all\" may be used to allow the assembler to\n           accept instructions valid for any supported processor,\n           including all optional extensions.\n\n           In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can\n           be told to accept, or restrict, various extension mnemonics\n           that extend the processor.\n\n           If some implementations of a particular processor can have an\n           extension, then then those extensions are automatically\n           enabled.  Consequently, you will not normally have to specify\n           any additional extensions.-march=architecture[+extension...]This option specifies the target architecture.  The assembler\n           will issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble\n           an instruction which will not execute on the target\n           architecture.  The following architecture names are\n           recognized: \"armv8-a\", \"armv8.1-a\", \"armv8.2-a\", \"armv8.3-a\",\n           \"armv8.4-a\" \"armv8.5-a\", \"armv8.6-a\", \"armv8.7-a\",\n           \"armv8.8-a\", \"armv8.9-a\", \"armv8-r\", \"armv9-a\", \"armv9.1-a\",\n           \"armv9.2-a\", \"armv9.3-a\" and \"armv9.4-a\".\n\n           If both-mcpuand-marchare specified, the assembler will\n           use the setting for-mcpu.  If neither are specified, the\n           assembler will default to-mcpu=all.\n\n           The architecture option can be extended with the same\n           instruction set extension options as the-mcpuoption.\n           Unlike-mcpu, extensions are not always enabled by default.-mverbose-errorThis option enables verbose error messages for AArch64 gas.\n           This option is enabled by default.-mno-verbose-errorThis option disables verbose error messages in AArch64 gas.\n\n       The following options are available when as is configured for an\n       Alpha processor.-mcpuThis option specifies the target processor.  If an attempt is\n           made to assemble an instruction which will not execute on the\n           target processor, the assembler may either expand the\n           instruction as a macro or issue an error message.  This\n           option is equivalent to the \".arch\" directive.\n\n           The following processor names are recognized: 21064,\n           \"21064a\", 21066, 21068, 21164, \"21164a\", \"21164pc\", 21264,\n           \"21264a\", \"21264b\", \"ev4\", \"ev5\", \"lca45\", \"ev5\", \"ev56\",\n           \"pca56\", \"ev6\", \"ev67\", \"ev68\".  The special name \"all\" may\n           be used to allow the assembler to accept instructions valid\n           for any Alpha processor.\n\n           In order to support existing practice in OSF/1 with respect\n           to \".arch\", and existing practice withinMILO(the Linux ARC\n           bootloader), the numbered processor names (e.g. 21064) enable\n           the processor-specific PALcode instructions, while the\n           \"electro-vlasic\" names (e.g. \"ev4\") do not.-mdebug-no-mdebugEnables or disables the generation of \".mdebug\" encapsulation\n           for stabs directives and procedure descriptors.  The default\n           is to automatically enable \".mdebug\" when the first stabs\n           directive is seen.-relaxThis option forces all relocations to be put into the object\n           file, instead of saving space and resolving some relocations\n           at assembly time.  Note that this option does not propagate\n           all symbol arithmetic into the object file, because not all\n           symbol arithmetic can be represented.  However, the option\n           can still be useful in specific applications.-replace-noreplaceEnables or disables the optimization of procedure calls, both\n           at assemblage and at link time.  These options are only\n           available for VMS targets and \"-replace\" is the default.  See\n           section 1.4.1 of the OpenVMS Linker Utility Manual.-gThis option is used when the compiler generates debug\n           information.

The semantics of branches does not provide for an ISA\n           mode switch, so in most cases the ISA mode a branch has been\n           encoded for has to be the same as the ISA mode of the\n           branch's target label.  Therefore GAS has checks implemented\n           that verify in branch assembly that the two ISA modes match.-mignore-branch-isadisables these checks.

The-mno-dsbtoption, the\n           default, causes the tag to have a value of 0, indicating that\n           the code does not use DSBT addressing.

If an attempt\n           is made to assemble an instruction that will not execute on\n           the target architecture, the assembler will issue an error\n           message.\n\n           The following names are recognized: \"mcm24\" \"mcm\" \"gr5\" \"gr6\"\n\n       The following options are available when as is configured for an\n       Xtensa processor.--text-section-literals | --no-text-section-literalsControl the treatment of literal pools.  The default is--no-text-section-literals, which places literals in separate\n           sections in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to\n           be placed in a data RAM/ROM.  With--text-section-literals,\n           the literals are interspersed in the text section in order to\n           keep them as close as possible to their references.  This may\n           be necessary for large assembly files, where the literals\n           would otherwise be out of range of the \"L32R\" instructions in\n           the text section.  Literals are grouped into pools following\n           \".literal_position\" directives or preceding \"ENTRY\"\n           instructions.  These options only affect literals referenced\n           via PC-relative \"L32R\" instructions; literals for absolute\n           mode \"L32R\" instructions are handled separately.--auto-litpools | --no-auto-litpoolsControl the treatment of literal pools.  The default is--no-auto-litpools, which in the absence of--text-section-literalsplaces literals in separate sections\n           in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be\n           placed in a data RAM/ROM.  With--auto-litpools, the literals\n           are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as\n           close as possible to their references, explicit\n           \".literal_position\" directives are not required.  This may be\n           necessary for very large functions, where single literal pool\n           at the beginning of the function may not be reachable by\n           \"L32R\" instructions at the end.  These options only affect\n           literals referenced via PC-relative \"L32R\" instructions;\n           literals for absolute mode \"L32R\" instructions are handled\n           separately.  When used together with--text-section-literals,--auto-litpoolstakes precedence.--absolute-literals | --no-absolute-literalsIndicate to the assembler whether \"L32R\" instructions use\n           absolute or PC-relative addressing.  If the processor\n           includes the absolute addressing option, the default is to\n           use absolute \"L32R\" relocations.  Otherwise, only the PC-\n           relative \"L32R\" relocations can be used.--target-align | --no-target-alignEnable or disable automatic alignment to reduce branch\n           penalties at some expense in code size.    This optimization\n           is enabled by default.  Note that the assembler will always\n           align instructions like \"LOOP\" that have fixed alignment\n           requirements.--longcalls | --no-longcallsEnable or disable transformation of call instructions to\n           allow calls across a greater range of addresses.    This\n           option should be used when call targets can potentially be\n           out of range.  It may degrade both code size and performance,\n           but the linker can generally optimize away the unnecessary\n           overhead when a call ends up within range.  The default is--no-longcalls.--transform | --no-transformEnable or disable all assembler transformations of Xtensa\n           instructions, including both relaxation and optimization.\n           The default is--transform;--no-transformshould only be\n           used in the rare cases when the instructions must be exactly\n           as specified in the assembly source.  Using--no-transformcauses out of range instruction operands to be errors.--rename-sectionoldname=newnameRename theoldnamesection tonewname.  This option can be\n           used multiple times to rename multiple sections.--trampolines | --no-trampolinesEnable or disable transformation of jump instructions to\n           allow jumps across a greater range of addresses.    This\n           option should be used when jump targets can potentially be\n           out of range.  In the absence of such jumps this option does\n           not affect code size or performance.  The default is--trampolines.--abi-windowed | --abi-call0Choose ABI tag written to the \".xtensa.info\" section.  ABI\n           tag indicates ABI of the assembly code.  A warning is issued\n           by the linker on an attempt to link object files with\n           inconsistent ABI tags.  Default ABI is chosen by the Xtensa\n           core configuration.\n\n       The following options are available when as is configured for an\n       Z80 processor.\n\n       @chapter Z80 Dependent FeaturesCommand-line Options-march=CPU[-EXT...][+EXT...]This option specifies the target processor. The assembler\n           will issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble\n           an instruction which will not execute on the target\n           processor. The following processor names are recognized:\n           \"z80\", \"z180\", \"ez80\", \"gbz80\", \"z80n\", \"r800\".  In addition\n           to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be told to\n           accept some extension mnemonics. For example,\n           \"-march=z180+sli+infc\" extendsz180withSLIinstructions andIN F,(C). The following extensions are currently supported:\n           \"full\" (all known instructions), \"adl\" (ADL CPU mode by\n           default, eZ80 only), \"sli\" (instruction known asSLI,SLLorSL1), \"xyhl\" (instructions with halves of index registers:IXL,IXH,IYL,IYH), \"xdcb\" (instructions likeRotOp (II+d),RandBitOp n,(II+d),R), \"infc\" (instructionIN F,(C)orIN(C)), \"outc0\" (instructionOUT (C),0).  Note that rather than\n           extending a basic instruction set, the extension mnemonics\n           starting with \"-\" revoke the respective functionality:\n           \"-march=z80-full+xyhl\" first removes all default extensions\n           and adds support for index registers halves only.\n\n           If this option is not specified then \"-march=z80+xyhl+infc\"\n           is assumed.-local-prefix=prefixMark all labels with specified prefix as local. But such\n           label can be marked global explicitly in the code. This\n           option do not change default local label prefix \".L\", it is\n           just adds new one.-colonlessAccept colonless labels.

        "description": "GNUasis really a family of assemblers.  If you use (or have\n       used) the GNU assembler on one architecture, you should find a\n       fairly similar environment when you use it on another\n       architecture.  Each version has much in common with the others,\n       including object file formats, most assembler directives (often\n       calledpseudo-ops) and assembler syntax.asis primarily intended to assemble the output of the GNU C\n       compiler \"gcc\" for use by the linker \"ld\".  Nevertheless, we've\n       tried to makeasassemble correctly everything that other\n       assemblers for the same machine would assemble.  Any exceptions\n       are documented explicitly.  This doesn't meanasalways uses the\n       same syntax as another assembler for the same architecture; for\n       example, we know of several incompatible versions of 680x0\n       assembly language syntax.\n\n       Each time you runasit assembles exactly one source program.\n       The source program is made up of one or more files.  (The\n       standard input is also a file.)\n\n       You giveasa command line that has zero or more input file\n       names.  The input files are read (from left file name to right).\n       A command-line argument (in any position) that has no special\n       meaning is taken to be an input file name.\n\n       If you giveasno file names it attempts to read one input file\n       from theasstandard input, which is normally your terminal.  You\n       may have to typectl-Dto tellasthere is no more program to\n       assemble.\n\n       Use--if you need to explicitly name the standard input file in\n       your command line.\n\n       If the source is empty,asproduces a small, empty object file.asmay write warnings and error messages to the standard error\n       file (usually your terminal).  This should not happen when  a\n       compiler runsasautomatically.  Warnings report an assumption\n       made so thatascould keep assembling a flawed program; errors\n       report a grave problem that stops the assembly.\n\n       If you are invokingasvia the GNU C compiler, you can use the-Waoption to pass arguments through to the assembler.  The\n       assembler arguments must be separated from each other (and the-Wa) by commas.  For example:\n\n               gcc -c -g -O -Wa,-alh,-L file.c\n\n       This passes two options to the assembler:-alh(emit a listing to\n       standard output with high-level and assembly source) and-L(retain local symbols in the symbol table).\n\n       Usually you do not need to use this-Wamechanism, since many\n       compiler command-line options are automatically passed to the\n       assembler by the compiler.  (You can call the GNU compiler driver\n       with the-voption to see precisely what options it passes to\n       each compilation pass, including the assembler.)",

A whitespace\n           character may be included in an option by surrounding the\n           entire option in either single or double quotes.

The resulting object file may not be\n           compatible with older linkers and object file utilities.\n           Note if compression would make a given sectionlargerthen it\n           is not compressed.--compress-debug-sections=none--compress-debug-sections=zlib--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gnu--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gabi--compress-debug-sections=zstdThese options control how DWARF debug sections are\n           compressed.--compress-debug-sections=noneis equivalent to--nocompress-debug-sections.--compress-debug-sections=zliband--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gabiare equivalent to--compress-debug-sections.--compress-debug-sections=zlib-gnucompresses DWARF debug\n           sections using the obsoleted zlib-gnu format.  The debug\n           sections are renamed to begin with.zdebug.--compress-debug-sections=zstdcompresses DWARF debug\n           sections using zstd.  Note - if compression would actually\n           make a sectionlarger, then it is not compressed nor renamed.--nocompress-debug-sectionsDo not compress DWARF debug sections.  This is usually the\n           default for all targets except the x86/x86_64, but a\n           configure time option can be used to override this.-DEnable debugging in target specific backends, if supported.\n           Otherwise ignored.  Even if ignored, this option is accepted\n           for script compatibility with calls to other assemblers.--debug-prefix-mapold=newWhen assembling files in directoryold, record debugging\n           information describing them as innewinstead.--defsymsym=valueDefine the symbolsymto bevaluebefore assembling the input\n           file.valuemust be an integer constant.

The\n           default can be controlled by a configure option--enable-elf-stt-common.--emulation=nameIf the assembler is configured to support multiple different\n           target configurations then this option can be used to select\n           the desired form.-f\"fast\"---skip whitespace and comment preprocessing (assume\n           source is compiler output).-g--gen-debugGenerate debugging information for each assembler source line\n           using whichever debug format is preferred by the target.\n           This currently means either STABS, ECOFF or DWARF2.  When the\n           debug format is DWARF then a \".debug_info\" and \".debug_line\"\n           section is only emitted when the assembly file doesn't\n           generate one itself.--gstabsGenerate stabs debugging information for each assembler line.\n           This may help debugging assembler code, if the debugger can\n           handle it.--gstabs+Generate stabs debugging information for each assembler line,\n           with GNU extensions that probably only gdb can handle, and\n           that could make other debuggers crash or refuse to read your\n           program.  This may help debugging assembler code.  Currently\n           the only GNU extension is the location of the current working\n           directory at assembling time.--gdwarf-2Generate DWARF2 debugging information for each assembler\n           line.  This may help debugging assembler code, if the\n           debugger can handle it.  Note---this option is only supported\n           by some targets, not all of them.--gdwarf-3This option is the same as the--gdwarf-2option, except that\n           it allows for the possibility of the generation of extra\n           debug information as per version 3 of the DWARF\n           specification.  Note - enabling this option does not\n           guarantee the generation of any extra information, the choice\n           to do so is on a per target basis.--gdwarf-4This option is the same as the--gdwarf-2option, except that\n           it allows for the possibility of the generation of extra\n           debug information as per version 4 of the DWARF\n           specification.  Note - enabling this option does not\n           guarantee the generation of any extra information, the choice\n           to do so is on a per target basis.--gdwarf-5This option is the same as the--gdwarf-2option, except that\n           it allows for the possibility of the generation of extra\n           debug information as per version 5 of the DWARF\n           specification.  Note - enabling this option does not\n           guarantee the generation of any extra information, the choice\n           to do so is on a per target basis.--gdwarf-sectionsInstead of creating a .debug_line section, create a series of\n           .debug_line.foosections wherefoois the name of the\n           corresponding code section.  For example a code section\n           called.text.funcwill have its dwarf line number information\n           placed into a section called.debug_line.text.func.  If the\n           code section is just called.textthen debug line section\n           will still be called just.debug_linewithout any suffix.--gdwarf-cie-version=versionControl which version of DWARF Common Information Entries\n           (CIEs) are produced.  When this flag is not specified the\n           default is version 1, though some targets can modify this\n           default.  Other possible values forversionare 3 or 4.--generate-missing-build-notes=yes--generate-missing-build-notes=noThese options control whether the ELF assembler should\n           generate GNU Build attribute notes if none are present in the\n           input sources.  The default can be controlled by the--enable-generate-build-notesconfigure option.--gsframe--gsframeCreate.sframesection from CFI directives.--hash-sizeNIgnored.  Supported for command line compatibility with other\n           assemblers.--helpPrint a summary of the command-line options and exit.--target-helpPrint a summary of all target specific options and exit.-IdirAdd directorydirto the search list for \".include\"\n           directives.-JDon't warn about signed overflow.-KIssue warnings when difference tables altered for long\n           displacements.-L--keep-localsKeep (in the symbol table) local symbols.  These symbols\n           start with system-specific local label prefixes, typically.Lfor ELF systems orLfor traditional a.out systems.--listing-lhs-width=numberSet the maximum width, in words, of the output data column\n           for an assembler listing tonumber.--listing-lhs-width2=numberSet the maximum width, in words, of the output data column\n           for continuation lines in an assembler listing tonumber.--listing-rhs-width=numberSet the maximum width of an input source line, as displayed\n           in a listing, tonumberbytes.--listing-cont-lines=numberSet the maximum number of lines printed in a listing for a\n           single line of input tonumber+ 1.--multibyte-handling=allow--multibyte-handling=warn--multibyte-handling=warn-sym-only--multibyte-handling=warn_sym_onlyControls how the assembler handles multibyte characters in\n           the input.  The default (which can be restored by using theallowargument) is to allow such characters without\n           complaint.  Using thewarnargument will make the assembler\n           generate a warning message whenever any multibyte character\n           is encountered.  Using thewarn-sym-onlyargument will only\n           cause a warning to be generated when a symbol is defined with\n           a name that contains multibyte characters.  (References to\n           undefined symbols will not generate a warning).--no-pad-sectionsStop the assembler for padding the ends of output sections to\n           the alignment of that section.  The default is to pad the\n           sections, but this can waste space which might be needed on\n           targets which have tight memory constraints.-oobjfileName the object-file output fromasobjfile.-RFold the data section into the text section.--reduce-memory-overheadsIgnored.  Supported for compatibility with tools that apss\n           the same option to both the assembler and the linker.--scfi=experimentalThis option controls whether the assembler should synthesize\n           CFI for hand-written input.  If the input already contains\n           some synthesizable CFI directives, the assembler ignores them\n           and emits a warning.  Note that \"--scfi=experimental\" is not\n           intended to be used for compiler-generated code, including\n           inline assembly.  This experimental support is work in\n           progress.  Only System V AMD64 ABI is supported.\n\n           Each input function in assembly must begin with the \".type\"\n           directive, and should ideally be closed off using a \".size\"\n           directive.  When using SCFI, each \".type\" directive prompts\n           GAS to start a new FDE (a.k.a., Function Descriptor Entry).\n           This implies that with each \".type\" directive, a previous\n           block of instructions, if any, is finalised as a distinct\n           FDE.--sectname-substHonor substitution sequences in section names.--size-check=error--size-check=warningIssue an error or warning for invalid ELF .size directive.--statisticsPrint the maximum space (in bytes) and total time (in\n           seconds) used by assembly.--strip-local-absoluteRemove local absolute symbols from the outgoing symbol table.-v-versionPrint theasversion.--versionPrint theasversion and exit.-W--no-warnSuppress warning messages.--fatal-warningsTreat warnings as errors.--warnDon't suppress warning messages or treat them as errors.-wIgnored.-xIgnored.-ZGenerate an object file even after errors.-- |files...Standard input, or source files to assemble.\n\n       The following options are available when as is configured for the\n       64-bit mode of the ARM Architecture (AArch64).-EBThis option specifies that the output generated by the\n           assembler should be marked as being encoded for a big-endian\n           processor.-ELThis option specifies that the output generated by the\n           assembler should be marked as being encoded for a little-\n           endian processor.-mabi=abiSpecify which ABI the source code uses.  The recognized\n           arguments are: \"ilp32\" and \"lp64\", which decides the\n           generated object file in ELF32 and ELF64 format respectively.\n           The default is \"lp64\".-mcpu=processor[+extension...]This option specifies the target processor.  The assembler\n           will issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble\n           an instruction which will not execute on the target\n           processor.  The following processor names are recognized:\n           \"cortex-a34\", \"cortex-a35\", \"cortex-a53\", \"cortex-a55\",\n           \"cortex-a57\", \"cortex-a65\", \"cortex-a65ae\", \"cortex-a72\",\n           \"cortex-a73\", \"cortex-a75\", \"cortex-a76\", \"cortex-a76ae\",\n           \"cortex-a77\", \"cortex-a78\", \"cortex-a78ae\", \"cortex-a78c\",\n           \"cortex-a510\", \"cortex-a520\", \"cortex-a710\", \"cortex-a720\",\n           \"ares\", \"exynos-m1\", \"falkor\", \"neoverse-n1\", \"neoverse-n2\",\n           \"neoverse-e1\", \"neoverse-v1\", \"qdf24xx\", \"saphira\",\n           \"thunderx\", \"vulcan\", \"xgene1\" \"xgene2\", \"cortex-r82\",\n           \"cortex-x1\", \"cortex-x2\", \"cortex-x3\", and \"cortex-x4\".  The\n           special name \"all\" may be used to allow the assembler to\n           accept instructions valid for any supported processor,\n           including all optional extensions.\n\n           In addition to the basic instruction set, the assembler can\n           be told to accept, or restrict, various extension mnemonics\n           that extend the processor.\n\n           If some implementations of a particular processor can have an\n           extension, then then those extensions are automatically\n           enabled.  Consequently, you will not normally have to specify\n           any additional extensions.-march=architecture[+extension...]This option specifies the target architecture.  The assembler\n           will issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble\n           an instruction which will not execute on the target\n           architecture.

If an attempt is\n           made to assemble an instruction which will not execute on the\n           target processor, the assembler may either expand the\n           instruction as a macro or issue an error message.  This\n           option is equivalent to the \".arch\" directive.\n\n           The following processor names are recognized: 21064,\n           \"21064a\", 21066, 21068, 21164, \"21164a\", \"21164pc\", 21264,\n           \"21264a\", \"21264b\", \"ev4\", \"ev5\", \"lca45\", \"ev5\", \"ev56\",\n           \"pca56\", \"ev6\", \"ev67\", \"ev68\".  The special name \"all\" may\n           be used to allow the assembler to accept instructions valid\n           for any Alpha processor.\n\n           In order to support existing practice in OSF/1 with respect\n           to \".arch\", and existing practice withinMILO(the Linux ARC\n           bootloader), the numbered processor names (e.g. 21064) enable\n           the processor-specific PALcode instructions, while the\n           \"electro-vlasic\" names (e.g. \"ev4\") do not.-mdebug-no-mdebugEnables or disables the generation of \".mdebug\" encapsulation\n           for stabs directives and procedure descriptors.

Note that this option does not propagate\n           all symbol arithmetic into the object file, because not all\n           symbol arithmetic can be represented.  However, the option\n           can still be useful in specific applications.-replace-noreplaceEnables or disables the optimization of procedure calls, both\n           at assemblage and at link time.  These options are only\n           available for VMS targets and \"-replace\" is the default.

For example\n           -march=rv32ima.  If this option and the architecture\n           attributes aren't set, then assembler will check the default\n           configure setting --with-arch=ISA.-misa-spec=ISAspecSelect the default isa spec version.  If the version of ISA\n           isn't set by -march, then assembler helps to set the version\n           according to the default chosen spec.  If this option isn't\n           set, then assembler will check the default configure setting\n           --with-isa-spec=ISAspec.-mpriv-spec=PRIVspecSelect the privileged spec version.  We can decide whether\n           the CSR is valid or not according to the chosen spec.

The-mno-dsbtoption, the\n           default, causes the tag to have a value of 0, indicating that\n           the code does not use DSBT addressing.  The linker will emit\n           a warning if objects of different type (DSBT and non-DSBT)\n           are linked together.-mpid=no-mpid=near-mpid=farThe-mpid=option causes the assembler to generate the\n           \"Tag_ABI_PID\" attribute with a value indicating the form of\n           data addressing used by the code.-mpid=no, the default,\n           indicates position-dependent data addressing,-mpid=nearindicates position-independent addressing with GOT accesses\n           using near DP addressing, and-mpid=farindicates position-\n           independent addressing with GOT accesses using far DP\n           addressing.  The linker will emit a warning if objects built\n           with different settings of this option are linked together.-mpic-mno-picThe-mpicoption causes the assembler to generate the\n           \"Tag_ABI_PIC\" attribute with a value of 1, indicating that\n           the code is using position-independent code addressing,  The\n           \"-mno-pic\" option, the default, causes the tag to have a\n           value of 0, indicating position-dependent code addressing.\n           The linker will emit a warning if objects of different type\n           (position-dependent and position-independent) are linked\n           together.-mbig-endian-mlittle-endianGenerate code for the specified endianness.

If an attempt\n           is made to assemble an instruction that will not execute on\n           the target architecture, the assembler will issue an error\n           message.\n\n           The following names are recognized: \"mcm24\" \"mcm\" \"gr5\" \"gr6\"\n\n       The following options are available when as is configured for an\n       Xtensa processor.--text-section-literals | --no-text-section-literalsControl the treatment of literal pools.  The default is--no-text-section-literals, which places literals in separate\n           sections in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to\n           be placed in a data RAM/ROM.  With--text-section-literals,\n           the literals are interspersed in the text section in order to\n           keep them as close as possible to their references.  This may\n           be necessary for large assembly files, where the literals\n           would otherwise be out of range of the \"L32R\" instructions in\n           the text section.  Literals are grouped into pools following\n           \".literal_position\" directives or preceding \"ENTRY\"\n           instructions.  These options only affect literals referenced\n           via PC-relative \"L32R\" instructions; literals for absolute\n           mode \"L32R\" instructions are handled separately.--auto-litpools | --no-auto-litpoolsControl the treatment of literal pools.  The default is--no-auto-litpools, which in the absence of--text-section-literalsplaces literals in separate sections\n           in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be\n           placed in a data RAM/ROM.  With--auto-litpools, the literals\n           are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as\n           close as possible to their references, explicit\n           \".literal_position\" directives are not required.  This may be\n           necessary for very large functions, where single literal pool\n           at the beginning of the function may not be reachable by\n           \"L32R\" instructions at the end.  These options only affect\n           literals referenced via PC-relative \"L32R\" instructions;\n           literals for absolute mode \"L32R\" instructions are handled\n           separately.  When used together with--text-section-literals,--auto-litpoolstakes precedence.--absolute-literals | --no-absolute-literalsIndicate to the assembler whether \"L32R\" instructions use\n           absolute or PC-relative addressing.  If the processor\n           includes the absolute addressing option, the default is to\n           use absolute \"L32R\" relocations.  Otherwise, only the PC-\n           relative \"L32R\" relocations can be used.--target-align | --no-target-alignEnable or disable automatic alignment to reduce branch\n           penalties at some expense in code size.    This optimization\n           is enabled by default.  Note that the assembler will always\n           align instructions like \"LOOP\" that have fixed alignment\n           requirements.--longcalls | --no-longcallsEnable or disable transformation of call instructions to\n           allow calls across a greater range of addresses.    This\n           option should be used when call targets can potentially be\n           out of range.  It may degrade both code size and performance,\n           but the linker can generally optimize away the unnecessary\n           overhead when a call ends up within range.  The default is--no-longcalls.--transform | --no-transformEnable or disable all assembler transformations of Xtensa\n           instructions, including both relaxation and optimization.\n           The default is--transform;--no-transformshould only be\n           used in the rare cases when the instructions must be exactly\n           as specified in the assembly source.  Using--no-transformcauses out of range instruction operands to be errors.--rename-sectionoldname=newnameRename theoldnamesection tonewname.  This option can be\n           used multiple times to rename multiple sections.--trampolines | --no-trampolinesEnable or disable transformation of jump instructions to\n           allow jumps across a greater range of addresses.    This\n           option should be used when jump targets can potentially be\n           out of range.  In the absence of such jumps this option does\n           not affect code size or performance.  The default is--trampolines.--abi-windowed | --abi-call0Choose ABI tag written to the \".xtensa.info\" section.  ABI\n           tag indicates ABI of the assembly code.  A warning is issued\n           by the linker on an attempt to link object files with\n           inconsistent ABI tags.  Default ABI is chosen by the Xtensa\n           core configuration.\n\n       The following options are available when as is configured for an\n       Z80 processor.\n\n       @chapter Z80 Dependent FeaturesCommand-line Options-march=CPU[-EXT...][+EXT...]This option specifies the target processor. The assembler\n           will issue an error message if an attempt is made to assemble\n           an instruction which will not execute on the target\n           processor. The following processor names are recognized:\n           \"z80\", \"z180\", \"ez80\", \"gbz80\", \"z80n\", \"r800\".  In addition\n           to the basic instruction set, the assembler can be told to\n           accept some extension mnemonics. For example,\n           \"-march=z180+sli+infc\" extendsz180withSLIinstructions andIN F,(C). The following extensions are currently supported:\n           \"full\" (all known instructions), \"adl\" (ADL CPU mode by\n           default, eZ80 only), \"sli\" (instruction known asSLI,SLLorSL1), \"xyhl\" (instructions with halves of index registers:IXL,IXH,IYL,IYH), \"xdcb\" (instructions likeRotOp (II+d),RandBitOp n,(II+d),R), \"infc\" (instructionIN F,(C)orIN(C)), \"outc0\" (instructionOUT (C),0).  Note that rather than\n           extending a basic instruction set, the extension mnemonics\n           starting with \"-\" revoke the respective functionality:\n           \"-march=z80-full+xyhl\" first removes all default extensions\n           and adds support for index registers halves only.\n\n           If this option is not specified then \"-march=z80+xyhl+infc\"\n           is assumed.-local-prefix=prefixMark all labels with specified prefix as local. But such\n           label can be marked global explicitly in the code. This\n           option do not change default local label prefix \".L\", it is\n           just adds new one.-colonlessAccept colonless labels.

System V systems, for example, have used the\n       login shell value for the user in/etc/passwd.  To select\n       reliably another command interpreter, the user must include it as\n       part of the script, such as:$at 1800\n           myshell myscript\n           EOTjob ... at ...$",

This sequence, which demonstrates redirecting standard error\n           to a pipe, is useful in a command procedure (the sequence of\n           output redirection specifications is significant):\n\n               at now + 1 hour <<!\n               diff file1 file2 2>&1 >outfile | mailx mygroup\n               !\n\n        3. To have a job reschedule itself,atcan be invoked from\n           within the at-job. For example, this daily processing script\n           namedmy.dailyruns every day (althoughcrontabis a more\n           appropriate vehicle for such work):\n\n               # my.daily runs every daydaily processingat now tomorrow < my.daily\n\n        4.

        "rationale": "Theatutility reads from standard input the commands to be\n       executed at a later time. It may be useful to redirect standard\n       output and standard error within the specified commands.\n\n       The-ttimeoption was added as a new capability to support an\n       internationalized way of specifying a time for execution of the\n       submitted job.\n\n       Early proposals added a ``jobname'' concept as a way of giving\n       submitted jobs names that are meaningful to the user submitting\n       them.  The historical, system-specifiedat_job_idgives no\n       indication of what the job is. Upon further reflection, it was\n       decided that the benefit of this was not worth the change in\n       historical interface. Theatfunctionality is useful in simple\n       environments, but in large or complex situations, the\n       functionality provided by the Batch Services option is more\n       suitable.\n\n       The-qoption historically has been an undocumented option, used\n       mainly by thebatchutility.\n\n       The System V-moption was added to provide a method for\n       informing users that an at-job had completed. Otherwise, users\n       are only informed when output to standard error or standard\n       output are not redirected.\n\n       The behavior ofat<now> was changed in an early proposal from\n       being unspecified to submitting a job for potentially immediate\n       execution. Historical BSDatimplementations support this.\n       Historical System V implementations give an error in that case,\n       but a change to the System V versions should have no backwards-\n       compatibility ramifications.\n\n       On BSD-based systems, a-uuseroption has allowed those with\n       appropriate privileges to access the work of other users. Since\n       this is primarily a system administration feature and is not\n       universally implemented, it has been omitted. Similarly, a\n       specification for the output format for a user with appropriate\n       privileges viewing the queues of other users has been omitted.\n\n       The-ffileoption from System V is used instead of the BSD\n       method of using the last operand as the pathname. The BSD method\n       is ambiguous\u2014does:\n\n           at 1200 friday\n\n       mean the same thing if there is a file namedfridayin the\n       current directory?\n\n       Theat_job_idis composed of a limited character set in\n       historical practice, and it is mandated here to invalidate\n       systems that might try using characters that require shell\n       quoting or that could not be easily parsed by shell scripts.\n\n       Theatutility varies between System V and BSD systems in the way\n       timezones are used. On System V systems, theTZvariable affects\n       the at-job submission times and the times displayed for the user.\n       On BSD systems,TZis not taken into account. The BSD behavior is\n       easily achieved with the current specification. If the user\n       wishes to have the timezone default to that of the system, they\n       merely need to issue theatcommand immediately following an\n       unsetting or null assignment toTZ.  For example:\n\n           TZ= at noon ...\n\n       gives the desired BSD result.\n\n       While theyacc-like grammar specified in the OPERANDS section is\n       lexically unambiguous with respect to the digit strings, a\n       lexical analyzer would probably be written to look for and return\n       digit strings in those cases. The parser could then check whether\n       the digit string returned is a validday_number,year_number, and\n       so on, based on the context.",

The action for a matching pattern shall be\n       executed before evaluating subsequent patterns. Finally, the\n       actions associated with allENDpatterns shall be executed in the\n       order they occur in the program.Expressions in awkExpressions describe computations used inpatternsandactions.\n       In the following table, valid expression operations are given in\n       groups from highest precedence first to lowest precedence last,\n       with equal-precedence operators grouped between horizontal lines.\n       In expression evaluation, where the grammar is formally\n       ambiguous, higher precedence operators shall be evaluated before\n       lower precedence operators. In this tableexpr,expr1,expr2, andexpr3represent any expression, while lvalue represents any\n       entity that can be assigned to (that is, on the left side of an\n       assignment operator).  The precise syntax of expressions is given\n       inGrammar.Table 4-1: Expressions in Decreasing Precedence

      Each expression shall have either a string value, a numeric\n       value, or both. Except as stated for specific contexts, the value\n       of an expression shall be implicitly converted to the type needed\n       for the context in which it is used. A string value shall be\n       converted to a numeric value either by the equivalent of the\n       following calls to functions defined by the ISO C standard:\n\n           setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, \"\");numeric_value= atof(string_value);\n\n       or by converting the initial portion of the string to typedoublerepresentation as follows:\n\n              The input string is decomposed into two parts: an initial,\n              possibly empty, sequence of white-space characters (as\n              specified byisspace()) and a subject sequence interpreted\n              as a floating-point constant.\n\n              The expected form of the subject sequence is an optional'+'or'-'sign, then a non-empty sequence of digits\n              optionally containing a <period>, then an optional\n              exponent part. An exponent part consists of'e'or'E',\n              followed by an optional sign, followed by one or more\n              decimal digits.\n\n              The sequence starting with the first digit or the <period>\n              (whichever occurs first) is interpreted as a floating\n              constant of the C language, and if neither an exponent\n              part nor a <period> appears, a <period> is assumed to\n              follow the last digit in the string. If the subject\n              sequence begins with a <hyphen-minus>, the value resulting\n              from the conversion is negated.\n\n       A numeric value that is exactly equal to the value of an integer\n       (seeSection 1.1.2,Concepts Derived from the ISO C Standard)\n       shall be converted to a string by the equivalent of a call to thesprintffunction (seeString Functions) with the string\"%d\"as\n       thefmtargument and the numeric value being converted as the\n       first and onlyexprargument. Any other numeric value shall be\n       converted to a string by the equivalent of a call to thesprintffunction with the value of the variableCONVFMTas thefmtargument and the numeric value being converted as the first and\n       onlyexprargument. The result of the conversion is unspecified\n       if the value ofCONVFMTis not a floating-point format\n       specification. This volume of POSIX.1\u20102017 specifies no explicit\n       conversions between numbers and strings. An application can force\n       an expression to be treated as a number by adding zero to it, or\n       can force it to be treated as a string by concatenating the null\n       string (\"\") to it.\n\n       A string value shall be considered anumeric stringif it comes\n       from one of the following:\n\n        1. Field variables\n\n        2. Input from thegetline() function\n\n        3.FILENAME4.ARGVarray elements\n\n        5.ENVIRONarray elements\n\n        6. Array elements created by thesplit() function\n\n        7. A command line variable assignment\n\n        8. Variable assignment from another numeric string variable\n\n       and an implementation-dependent condition corresponding to either\n       case (a) or (b) below is met.\n\n        a. After the equivalent of the following calls to functions\n           defined by the ISO C standard,string_value_endwould differ\n           fromstring_value, and any characters before the terminating\n           null character instring_value_endwould be <blank>\n           characters:\n\n               char *string_value_end;\n               setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, \"\");\n               numeric_value = strtod (string_value, &string_value_end);\n\n        b. After all the following conversions have been applied, the\n           resulting string would lexically be recognized as aNUMBERtoken as described by the lexical conventions inGrammar:\n\n           --  All leading and trailing <blank> characters are\n               discarded.\n\n           --  If the first non-<blank> is'+'or'-', it is discarded.\n\n           --  Each occurrence of the decimal point character from the\n               current locale is changed to a <period>.\n       In case (a) the numeric value of thenumeric stringshall be the\n       value that would be returned by thestrtod() call. In case (b) if\n       the first non-<blank> is'-', the numeric value of thenumericstringshall be the negation of the numeric value of the\n       recognizedNUMBERtoken; otherwise, the numeric value of thenumeric stringshall be the numeric value of the recognizedNUMBERtoken. Whether or not a string is anumeric stringshall\n       be relevant only in contexts where that term is used in this\n       section.\n\n       When an expression is used in a Boolean context, if it has a\n       numeric value, a value of zero shall be treated as false and any\n       other value shall be treated as true. Otherwise, a string value\n       of the null string shall be treated as false and any other value\n       shall be treated as true.  A Boolean context shall be one of the\n       following:\n\n        *  The first subexpression of a conditional expression\n\n        *  An expression operated on by logical NOT, logical AND, or\n           logical OR\n\n        *  The second expression of aforstatement\n\n        *  The expression of anifstatement\n\n        *  The expression of thewhileclause in either awhileordo...whilestatement\n\n        *  An expression used as a pattern (as in Overall Program\n           Structure)\n\n       All arithmetic shall follow the semantics of floating-point\n       arithmetic as specified by the ISO C standard (seeSection 1.1.2,Concepts Derived from the ISO C Standard).\n\n       The value of the expression:expr1^expr2shall be equivalent to the value returned by the ISO C standard\n       function call:\n\n           pow(expr1,expr2)\n\n       The expression:\n\n           lvalue ^=exprshall be equivalent to the ISO C standard expression:\n\n           lvalue = pow(lvalue,expr)\n\n       except that lvalue shall be evaluated only once. The value of the\n       expression:expr1%expr2shall be equivalent to the value returned by the ISO C standard\n       function call:\n\n           fmod(expr1,expr2)\n\n       The expression:\n\n           lvalue %=exprshall be equivalent to the ISO C standard expression:\n\n           lvalue = fmod(lvalue,expr)\n\n       except that lvalue shall be evaluated only once.\n\n       Variables and fields shall be set by the assignment statement:\n\n           lvalue =expressionand the type ofexpressionshall determine the resulting variable\n       type. The assignment includes the arithmetic assignments (\"+=\",\"-=\",\"*=\",\"/=\",\"%=\",\"^=\",\"++\",\"--\") all of which shall\n       produce a numeric result. The left-hand side of an assignment and\n       the target of increment and decrement operators can be one of a\n       variable, an array with index, or a field selector.\n\n       Theawklanguage supplies arrays that are used for storing\n       numbers or strings.  Arrays need not be declared. They shall\n       initially be empty, and their sizes shall change dynamically. The\n       subscripts, or element identifiers, are strings, providing a type\n       of associative array capability. An array name followed by a\n       subscript within square brackets can be used as an lvalue and\n       thus as an expression, as described in the grammar; seeGrammar.\n       Unsubscripted array names can be used in only the following\n       contexts:\n\n        *  A parameter in a function definition or function call\n\n        *  TheNAMEtoken following any use of the keywordinas\n           specified in the grammar (seeGrammar); if the name used in\n           this context is not an array name, the behavior is undefined\n\n       A valid arrayindexshall consist of one or more\n       <comma>-separated expressions, similar to the way in which multi-\n       dimensional arrays are indexed in some programming languages.\n       Becauseawkarrays are really one-dimensional, such a\n       <comma>-separated list shall be converted to a single string by\n       concatenating the string values of the separate expressions, each\n       separated from the other by the value of theSUBSEPvariable.\n       Thus, the following two index operations shall be equivalent:var[expr1,expr2, ...exprn]var[expr1SUBSEPexpr2SUBSEP ... SUBSEPexprn]The application shall ensure that a multi-dimensionedindexused\n       with theinoperator is parenthesized. Theinoperator, which\n       tests for the existence of a particular array element, shall not\n       cause that element to exist. Any other reference to a nonexistent\n       array element shall automatically create it.\n\n       Comparisons (with the'<',\"<=\",\"!=\",\"==\",'>', and\">=\"operators) shall be made numerically if both operands are\n       numeric, if one is numeric and the other has a string value that\n       is a numeric string, or if one is numeric and the other has the\n       uninitialized value.  Otherwise, operands shall be converted to\n       strings as required and a string comparison shall be made as\n       follows:\n\n        *  For the\"!=\"and\"==\"operators, the strings should be\n           compared to check if they are identical but may be compared\n           using the locale-specific collation sequence to check if they\n           collate equally.\n\n        *  For the other operators, the strings shall be compared using\n           the locale-specific collation sequence.\n\n       The value of the comparison expression shall be 1 if the relation\n       is true, or 0 if the relation is false.Variables and Special VariablesVariables can be used in anawkprogram by referencing them. With\n       the exception of function parameters (seeUser-DefinedFunctions), they are not explicitly declared. Function parameter\n       names shall be local to the function; all other variable names\n       shall be global. The same name shall not be used as both a\n       function parameter name and as the name of a function or a\n       specialawkvariable. The same name shall not be used both as a\n       variable name with global scope and as the name of a function.\n       The same name shall not be used within the same scope both as a\n       scalar variable and as an array.  Uninitialized variables,\n       including scalar variables, array elements, and field variables,\n       shall have an uninitialized value. An uninitialized value shall\n       have both a numeric value of zero and a string value of the empty\n       string. Evaluation of variables with an uninitialized value, to\n       either string or numeric, shall be determined by the context in\n       which they are used.\n\n       Field variables shall be designated by a'$'followed by a number\n       or numerical expression. The effect of the field numberexpressionevaluating to anything other than a non-negative\n       integer is unspecified; uninitialized variables or string values\n       need not be converted to numeric values in this context. New\n       field variables can be created by assigning a value to them.\n       References to nonexistent fields (that is, fields after $NF),\n       shall evaluate to the uninitialized value. Such references shall\n       not create new fields. However, assigning to a nonexistent field\n       (for example, $(NF+2)=5) shall increase the value ofNF; create\n       any intervening fields with the uninitialized value; and cause\n       the value of $0 to be recomputed, with the fields being separated\n       by the value ofOFS.  Each field variable shall have a string\n       value or an uninitialized value when created. Field variables\n       shall have the uninitialized value when created from $0 usingFSand the variable does not contain any characters. If appropriate,\n       the field variable shall be considered a numeric string (seeExpressions in awk).\n\n       Implementations shall support the following other special\n       variables that are set byawk:ARGCThe number of elements in theARGVarray.ARGVAn array of command line arguments, excluding options\n                 and theprogramargument, numbered from zero toARGC-1.\n\n                 The arguments inARGVcan be modified or added to;ARGCcan be altered. As each input file ends,awkshall\n                 treat the next non-null element ofARGV, up to the\n                 current value ofARGC-1, inclusive, as the name of the\n                 next input file. Thus, setting an element ofARGVto\n                 null means that it shall not be treated as an input\n                 file. The name'-'indicates the standard input. If an\n                 argument matches the format of anassignmentoperand,\n                 this argument shall be treated as anassignmentrather\n                 than afileargument.CONVFMTTheprintfformat for converting numbers to strings\n                 (except for output statements, whereOFMTis used);\"%.6g\"by default.ENVIRONAn array representing the value of the environment, as\n                 described in theexecfunctions defined in the System\n                 Interfaces volume of POSIX.1\u20102017.

If  the  regular  expression matches the\n       string, the'~'expression shall evaluate to a value  of  1,  and\n       the\"!~\"expression shall evaluate to a value of 0.

Otherwise, ifFSis any other characterc, fields shall\n               be delimited by each single occurrence ofc.\n\n        3. Otherwise, the string value ofFSshall be considered to be\n           an extended regular expression. Each occurrence of a sequence\n           matching the extended regular expression shall delimit\n           fields.\n\n       Except for the'~'and\"!~\"operators, and in thegsub,match,split, andsubbuilt-in functions, ERE matching shall be based on\n       input records; that is, record separator characters (the first\n       character of the value of the variableRS, <newline> by default)\n       cannot be embedded in the expression, and no expression shall\n       match the record separator character. If the record separator is\n       not <newline>, <newline> characters embedded in the expression\n       can be matched. For the'~'and\"!~\"operators, and in those four\n       built-in functions, ERE matching shall be based on text strings;\n       that is, any character (including <newline> and the record\n       separator) can be embedded in the pattern, and an appropriate\n       pattern shall match any character. However, in allawkERE\n       matching, the use of one or more NUL characters in the pattern,\n       input record, or text string produces undefined results.PatternsApatternis any validexpression, a range specified by two\n       expressions separated by a comma, or one of the two special\n       patternsBEGINorEND.Special PatternsTheawkutility shall recognize two special patterns,BEGINandEND.  EachBEGINpattern shall be matched once and its associated\n       action executed before the first record of input is read\u2014except\n       possibly by use of thegetlinefunction (seeInput/Output andGeneral Functions) in a priorBEGINaction\u2014and before command\n       line assignment is done. EachENDpattern shall be matched once\n       and its associated action executed after the last record of input\n       has been read. These two patterns shall have associated actions.BEGINandENDshall not combine with other patterns. MultipleBEGINandENDpatterns shall be allowed. The actions associated\n       with theBEGINpatterns shall be executed in the order specified\n       in the program, as are theENDactions. AnENDpattern can\n       precede aBEGINpattern in a program.\n\n       If anawkprogram consists of only actions with the patternBEGIN, and theBEGINaction contains nogetlinefunction,awkshall exit without reading its input when the last statement in\n       the lastBEGINaction is executed. If anawkprogram consists of\n       only actions with the patternENDor only actions with the\n       patternsBEGINandEND, the input shall be read before the\n       statements in theENDactions are executed.Expression PatternsAn expression pattern shall be evaluated as if it were an\n       expression in a Boolean context. If the result is true, the\n       pattern shall be considered to match, and the associated action\n       (if any) shall be executed. If the result is false, the action\n       shall not be executed.Pattern RangesA pattern range consists of two expressions separated by a comma;\n       in this case, the action shall be performed for all records\n       between a match of the first expression and the following match\n       of the second expression, inclusive. At this point, the pattern\n       range can be repeated starting at input records subsequent to the\n       end of the matched range.ActionsAn action is a sequence of statements as shown in the grammar inGrammar.  Any single statement can be replaced by a statement\n       list enclosed in curly braces. The application shall ensure that\n       statements in a statement list are separated by <newline> or\n       <semicolon> characters. Statements in a statement list shall be\n       executed sequentially in the order that they appear.\n\n       Theexpressionacting as the conditional in anifstatement shall\n       be evaluated and if it is non-zero or non-null, the following\n       statement shall be executed; otherwise, ifelseis present, the\n       statement following theelseshall be executed.\n\n       Theif,while,do...while,for,break, andcontinuestatements\n       are based on the ISO C standard (seeSection 1.1.2,ConceptsDerived from the ISO C Standard), except that the Boolean\n       expressions shall be treated as described inExpressions in awk,\n       and except in the case of:\n\n           for (variableinarray)\n\n       which shall iterate, assigning eachindexofarraytovariablein\n       an unspecified order. The results of adding new elements toarraywithin such aforloop are undefined. If abreakorcontinuestatement occurs outside of a loop, the behavior is undefined.\n\n       Thedeletestatement shall remove an individual array element.\n       Thus, the following code deletes an entire array:\n\n           for (index in array)\n               delete array[index]\n\n       Thenextstatement shall cause all further processing of the\n       current input record to be abandoned. The behavior is undefined\n       if anextstatement appears or is invoked in aBEGINorENDaction.\n\n       Theexitstatement shall invoke allENDactions in the order in\n       which they occur in the program source and then terminate the\n       program without reading further input. Anexitstatement inside\n       anENDaction shall terminate the program without further\n       execution ofENDactions. If an expression is specified in anexitstatement, its numeric value shall be the exit status ofawk, unless subsequent errors are encountered or a subsequentexitstatement with an expression is executed.Output StatementsBothprintandprintfstatements shall write to standard output\n       by default. The output shall be written to the location specified\n       byoutput_redirectionif one is supplied, as follows:\n\n           >expression>>expression|expressionIn all cases, theexpressionshall be evaluated to produce a\n       string that is used as a pathname into which to write (for'>'or\">>\") or as a command to be executed (for'|').  Using the first\n       two forms, if the file of that name is not currently open, it\n       shall be opened, creating it if necessary and using the first\n       form, truncating the file. The output then shall be appended to\n       the file. As long as the file remains open, subsequent calls in\n       whichexpressionevaluates to the same string value shall simply\n       append output to the file. The file remains open until theclosefunction (seeInput/Output and General Functions) is called with\n       an expression that evaluates to the same string value.\n\n       The third form shall write output onto a stream piped to the\n       input of a command. The stream shall be created if no stream is\n       currently open with the value ofexpressionas its command name.\n       The stream created shall be equivalent to one created by a call\n       to thepopen() function defined in the System Interfaces volume\n       of POSIX.1\u20102017 with the value ofexpressionas thecommandargument and a value ofwas themodeargument. As long as the\n       stream remains open, subsequent calls in whichexpressionevaluates to the same string value shall write output to the\n       existing stream. The stream shall remain open until theclosefunction (seeInput/Output and General Functions) is called with\n       an expression that evaluates to the same string value.  At that\n       time, the stream shall be closed as if by a call to thepclose()\n       function defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1\u20102017.\n\n       As described in detail by the grammar inGrammar, these output\n       statements shall take a <comma>-separated list ofexpressions\n       referred to in the grammar by the non-terminal symbolsexpr_list,print_expr_list, orprint_expr_list_opt.  This list is referred\n       to here as theexpression list, and each member is referred to as\n       anexpression argument.\n\n       Theprintstatement shall write the value of each expression\n       argument onto the indicated output stream separated by the\n       current output field separator (see variableOFSabove), and\n       terminated by the output record separator (see variableORSabove). All expression arguments shall be taken as strings, being\n       converted if necessary; this conversion shall be as described inExpressions in awk, with the exception that theprintfformat inOFMTshall be used instead of the value inCONVFMT.  An empty\n       expression list shall stand for the whole input record ($0).\n\n       Theprintfstatement shall produce output based on a notation\n       similar to the File Format Notation used to describe file formats\n       in this volume of POSIX.1\u20102017 (see the Base Definitions volume\n       of POSIX.1\u20102017,Chapter 5,File Format Notation).  Output shall\n       be produced as specified with the firstexpressionargument as\n       the stringformatand subsequentexpressionarguments as the\n       stringsarg1toargn, inclusive, with the following exceptions:\n\n        1. Theformatshall be an actual character string rather than a\n           graphical representation. Therefore, it cannot contain empty\n           character positions. The <space> in theformatstring, in any\n           context other than aflagof a conversion specification,\n           shall be treated as an ordinary character that is copied to\n           the output.\n\n        2. If the character set contains a'' character and that\n           character appears in theformatstring, it shall be treated\n           as an ordinary character that is copied to the output.\n\n        3. Theescape sequencesbeginning with a <backslash> character\n           shall be treated as sequences of ordinary characters that are\n           copied to the output. Note that these same sequences shall be\n           interpreted lexically byawkwhen they appear in literal\n           strings, but they shall not be treated specially by theprintfstatement.\n\n        4. Afield widthorprecisioncan be specified as the'*'character instead of a digit string. In this case the next\n           argument from the expression list shall be fetched and its\n           numeric value taken as the field width or precision.\n\n        5. The implementation shall not precede or follow output from\n           thedoruconversion specifier characters with <blank>\n           characters not specified by theformatstring.\n\n        6. The implementation shall not precede output from theoconversion specifier character with leading zeros not\n           specified by theformatstring.\n\n        7. For thecconversion specifier character: if the argument has\n           a numeric value, the character whose encoding is that value\n           shall be output. If the value is zero or is not the encoding\n           of any character in the character set, the behavior is\n           undefined. If the argument does not have a numeric value, the\n           first character of the string value shall be output; if the\n           string does not contain any characters, the behavior is\n           undefined.\n\n        8. For each conversion specification that consumes an argument,\n           the next expression argument shall be evaluated. With the\n           exception of thecconversion specifier character, the value\n           shall be converted (according to the rules specified inExpressions in awk) to the appropriate type for the\n           conversion specification.\n\n        9. If there are insufficient expression arguments to satisfy all\n           the conversion specifications in theformatstring, the\n           behavior is undefined.\n\n       10. If any character sequence in theformatstring begins with a'%'character, but does not form a valid conversion\n           specification, the behavior is unspecified.\n\n       Bothprintandprintfcan output at least {LINE_MAX} bytes.FunctionsTheawklanguage has a variety of built-in functions: arithmetic,\n       string, input/output, and general.Arithmetic FunctionsThe arithmetic functions, except forint, shall be based on the\n       ISO C standard (seeSection 1.1.2,Concepts Derived from the ISOC Standard).  The behavior is undefined in cases where the ISO C\n       standard specifies that an error be returned or that the behavior\n       is undefined. Although the grammar (seeGrammar) permits built-in\n       functions to appear with no arguments or parentheses, unless the\n       argument or parentheses are indicated as optional in the\n       following list (by displaying them within the\"[]\"brackets),\n       such use is undefined.atan2(y,x)\n                 Return arctangent ofy/xin radians in the range\n                 [-\u03c0,\u03c0].cos(x)    Return cosine ofx, wherexis in radians.sin(x)    Return sine ofx, wherexis in radians.exp(x)    Return the exponential function ofx.log(x)    Return the natural logarithm ofx.sqrt(x)   Return the square root ofx.int(x)    Return the argument truncated to an integer. Truncation\n                 shall be toward 0 whenx>0.rand()    Return a random numbern, such that 0\u2264n<1.srand([expr])\n                 Set the seed value forrandtoexpror use the time of\n                 day ifexpris omitted. The previous seed value shall\n                 be returned.String FunctionsThe string functions in the following list shall be supported.\n       Although the grammar (seeGrammar) permits built-in functions to\n       appear with no arguments or parentheses, unless the argument or\n       parentheses are indicated as optional in the following list (by\n       displaying them within the\"[]\"brackets), such use is undefined.gsub(ere,repl[,in])\n                 Behave likesub(see below), except that it shall\n                 replace all occurrences of the regular expression (like\n                 theedutility global substitute) in $0 or in theinargument, when specified.index(s,t)\n                 Return the position, in characters, numbering from 1,\n                 in stringswhere stringtfirst occurs, or zero if it\n                 does not occur at all.length[([s])]Return the length, in characters, of its argument taken\n                 as a string, or of the whole record, $0, if there is no\n                 argument.match(s,ere)\n                 Return the position, in characters, numbering from 1,\n                 in stringswhere the extended regular expressionereoccurs, or zero if it does not occur at all. RSTART\n                 shall be set to the starting position (which is the\n                 same as the returned value), zero if no match is found;\n                 RLENGTH shall be set to the length of the matched\n                 string, -1 if no match is found.split(s,a[,fs])\n                 Split the stringsinto array elementsa[1],a[2], ...,a[n], and returnn.  All elements of the array shall be\n                 deleted before the split is performed. The separation\n                 shall be done with the EREfsor with the field\n                 separatorFSiffsis not given. Each array element\n                 shall have a string value when created and, if\n                 appropriate, the array element shall be considered a\n                 numeric string (seeExpressions in awk).  The effect of\n                 a null string as the value offsis unspecified.sprintf(fmt,expr,expr, ...)\n                 Format the expressions according to theprintfformat\n                 given byfmtand return the resulting string.sub(ere,repl[,in])\n                 Substitute the stringreplin place of the first\n                 instance of the extended regular expressionEREin\n                 stringinand return the number of substitutions. An\n                 <ampersand> ('&') appearing in the stringreplshall be\n                 replaced by the string frominthat matches the ERE. An\n                 <ampersand> preceded with a <backslash> shall be\n                 interpreted as the literal <ampersand> character. An\n                 occurrence of two consecutive <backslash> characters\n                 shall be interpreted as just a single literal\n                 <backslash> character. Any other occurrence of a\n                 <backslash> (for example, preceding any other\n                 character) shall be treated as a literal <backslash>\n                 character. Note that ifreplis a string literal (the\n                 lexical tokenSTRING; seeGrammar), the handling of the\n                 <ampersand> character occurs after any lexical\n                 processing, including any lexical <backslash>-escape\n                 sequence processing. Ifinis specified and it is not\n                 an lvalue (seeExpressions in awk), the behavior is\n                 undefined. Ifinis omitted,awkshall use the current\n                 record ($0) in its place.substr(s,m[,n])\n                 Return the at mostn-character substring ofsthat\n                 begins at positionm, numbering from 1. Ifnis\n                 omitted, or ifnspecifies more characters than are\n                 left in the string, the length of the substring shall\n                 be limited by the length of the strings.tolower(s)\n                 Return a string based on the strings.  Each character\n                 insthat is an uppercase letter specified to have atolowermapping by theLC_CTYPEcategory of the current\n                 locale shall be replaced in the returned string by the\n                 lowercase letter specified by the mapping. Other\n                 characters insshall be unchanged in the returned\n                 string.toupper(s)\n                 Return a string based on the strings.  Each character\n                 insthat is a lowercase letter specified to have atouppermapping by theLC_CTYPEcategory of the current\n                 locale is replaced in the returned string by the\n                 uppercase letter specified by the mapping. Other\n                 characters insare unchanged in the returned string.\n\n       All of the preceding functions that takeEREas a parameter\n       expect a pattern or a string valued expression that is a regular\n       expression as defined inRegular Expressions.Input/Output and General FunctionsThe input/output and general functions are:close(expression)\n                 Close the file or pipe opened by aprintorprintfstatement or a call togetlinewith the same string-\n                 valuedexpression.  The limit on the number of openexpressionarguments is implementation-defined. If the\n                 close was successful, the function shall return zero;\n                 otherwise, it shall return non-zero.expression |getline [var]Read a record of input from a stream piped from the\n                 output of a command. The stream shall be created if no\n                 stream is currently open with the value ofexpressionas its command name. The stream created shall be\n                 equivalent to one created by a call to thepopen()\n                 function with the value ofexpressionas thecommandargument and a value ofras themodeargument. As long\n                 as the stream remains open, subsequent calls in whichexpressionevaluates to the same string value shall\n                 read subsequent records from the stream. The stream\n                 shall remain open until theclosefunction is called\n                 with an expression that evaluates to the same string\n                 value. At that time, the stream shall be closed as if\n                 by a call to thepclose() function. Ifvaris omitted,\n                 $0 andNFshall be set; otherwise,varshall be set\n                 and, if appropriate, it shall be considered a numeric\n                 string (seeExpressions in awk).\n\n                 Thegetlineoperator can form ambiguous constructs when\n                 there are unparenthesized operators (including\n                 concatenate) to the left of the'|'(to the beginning\n                 of the expression containinggetline).  In the context\n                 of the'$'operator,'|'shall behave as if it had a\n                 lower precedence than'$'.  The result of evaluating\n                 other operators is unspecified, and conforming\n                 applications shall parenthesize properly all such\n                 usages.getlineSet $0 to the next input record from the current input\n                 file. This form ofgetlineshall set theNF,NR, andFNRvariables.getlinevarSet variablevarto the next input record from the\n                 current input file and, if appropriate,varshall be\n                 considered a numeric string (seeExpressions in awk).\n                 This form ofgetlineshall set theFNRandNRvariables.getline [var]<expressionRead the next record of input from a named file. Theexpressionshall be evaluated to produce a string that\n                 is used as a pathname.  If the file of that name is not\n                 currently open, it shall be opened. As long as the\n                 stream remains open, subsequent calls in whichexpressionevaluates to the same string value shall\n                 read subsequent records from the file. The file shall\n                 remain open until theclosefunction is called with an\n                 expression that evaluates to the same string value. Ifvaris omitted, $0 andNFshall be set; otherwise,varshall be set and, if appropriate, it shall be\n                 considered a numeric string (seeExpressions in awk).\n\n                 Thegetlineoperator can form ambiguous constructs when\n                 there are unparenthesized binary operators (including\n                 concatenate) to the right of the'<'(up to the end of\n                 the expression containing thegetline).  The result of\n                 evaluating such a construct is unspecified, and\n                 conforming applications shall parenthesize properly all\n                 such usages.system(expression)\n                 Execute the command given byexpressionin a manner\n                 equivalent to thesystem() function defined in the\n                 System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1\u20102017 and return the\n                 exit status of the command.\n\n       All forms ofgetlineshall return 1 for successful input, zero\n       for end-of-file, and -1 for an error.\n\n       Where strings are used as the name of a file or pipeline, the\n       application shall ensure that the strings are textually\n       identical. The terminology ``same string value'' implies that\n       ``equivalent strings'', even those that differ only by <space>\n       characters, represent different files.User-Defined FunctionsTheawklanguage also provides user-defined functions. Such\n       functions can be defined as:\n\n           functionname([parameter, ...]) {statements}\n\n       A function can be referred to anywhere in anawkprogram; in\n       particular, its use can precede its definition. The scope of a\n       function is global.\n\n       Function parameters, if present, can be either scalars or arrays;\n       the behavior is undefined if an array name is passed as a\n       parameter that the function uses as a scalar, or if a scalar\n       expression is passed as a parameter that the function uses as an\n       array. Function parameters shall be passed by value if scalar and\n       by reference if array name.\n\n       The number of parameters in the function definition need not\n       match the number of parameters in the function call. Excess\n       formal parameters can be used as local variables. If fewer\n       arguments are supplied in a function call than are in the\n       function definition, the extra parameters that are used in the\n       function body as scalars shall evaluate to the uninitialized\n       value until they are otherwise initialized, and the extra\n       parameters that are used in the function body as arrays shall be\n       treated as uninitialized arrays where each element evaluates to\n       the uninitialized value until otherwise initialized.\n\n       When invoking a function, no white space can be placed between\n       the function name and the opening parenthesis. Function calls can\n       be nested and recursive calls can be made upon functions. Upon\n       return from any nested or recursive function call, the values of\n       all of the calling function's parameters shall be unchanged,\n       except for array parameters passed by reference. Thereturnstatement can be used to return a value. If areturnstatement\n       appears outside of a function definition, the behavior is\n       undefined.\n\n       In the function definition, <newline> characters shall be\n       optional before the opening brace and after the closing brace.\n       Function definitions can appear anywhere in the program where apattern-actionpair is allowed.GrammarThe grammar in this section and the lexical conventions in the\n       following section shall together describe the syntax forawkprograms. The general conventions for this style of grammar are\n       described inSection 1.3,Grammar Conventions.  A valid program\n       can be represented as the non-terminal symbolprogramin the\n       grammar. This formal syntax shall take precedence over the\n       preceding text syntax description.\n\n           %token NAME NUMBER STRING ERE\n           %token FUNC_NAME   /* Name followed by '(' without white space. */\n\n           /* Keywords */\n           %token       Begin   End\n           /*          'BEGIN' 'END'                            */\n\n           %token       Break   Continue   Delete   Do   Else\n           /*          'break' 'continue' 'delete' 'do' 'else'  */\n\n           %token       Exit   For   Function   If   In\n           /*          'exit' 'for' 'function' 'if' 'in'        */\n\n           %token       Next   Print   Printf   Return   While\n           /*          'next' 'print' 'printf' 'return' 'while' */\n\n           /* Reserved function names */\n           %token BUILTIN_FUNC_NAME\n                       /* One token for the following:\n                        * atan2 cos sin exp log sqrt int rand srand\n                        * gsub index length match split sprintf sub\n                        * substr tolower toupper close system\n                        */\n           %token GETLINE\n                       /* Syntactically different from other built-ins. */\n\n           /* Two-character tokens. */\n           %token ADD_ASSIGN SUB_ASSIGN MUL_ASSIGN DIV_ASSIGN MOD_ASSIGN POW_ASSIGN\n           /*     '+='       '-='       '*='       '/='       '%='       '^=' */\n\n           %token OR   AND  NO_MATCH   EQ   LE   GE   NE   INCR  DECR  APPEND\n           /*     '||' '&&' '!~' '==' '<=' '>=' '!=' '++'  '--'  '>>'   */\n\n           /* One-character tokens. */\n           %token '{' '}' '(' ')' '[' ']' ',' ';' NEWLINE\n           %token '+' '-' '*' '%' '^' '!'

associativity shall be as described\n           inTable 4-1, Expressions in Decreasing Precedence in awk.\n\n        *  In case of ambiguity, anelseshall be associated with the\n           most immediately precedingifthat would satisfy the grammar.\n\n        *  In some contexts, a <slash> ('/') that is used to surround an\n           ERE could also be the division operator.  This shall be\n           resolved in such a way that wherever the division operator\n           could appear, a <slash> is assumed to be the division\n           operator. (There is no unary division operator.)\n\n       Each expression in anawkprogram shall conform to the precedence\n       and associativity rules, even when this is not needed to resolve\n       an ambiguity. For example, because'$'has higher precedence than'++', the string\"$x++--\"is not a validawkexpression, even\n       though it is unambiguously parsed by the grammar as\"$(x++)--\".\n\n       One convention that might not be obvious from the formal grammar\n       is where <newline> characters are acceptable. There are several\n       obvious placements such as terminating a statement, and a\n       <backslash> can be used to escape <newline> characters between\n       any lexical tokens. In addition, <newline> characters without\n       <backslash> characters can follow a comma, an open brace, logical\n       AND operator (\"&&\"), logical OR operator (\"||\"), thedokeyword,\n       theelsekeyword, and the closing parenthesis of anif,for, orwhilestatement. For example:\n\n           { print  $1,\n                    $2 }Lexical ConventionsThe lexical conventions forawkprograms, with respect to the\n       preceding grammar, shall be as follows:\n\n        1. Except as noted,awkshall recognize the longest possible\n           token or delimiter beginning at a given point.\n\n        2. A comment shall consist of any characters beginning with the\n           <number-sign> character and terminated by, but excluding the\n           next occurrence of, a <newline>.  Comments shall have no\n           effect, except to delimit lexical tokens.\n\n        3. The <newline> shall be recognized as the tokenNEWLINE.\n\n        4. A <backslash> character immediately followed by a <newline>\n           shall have no effect.\n\n        5. The tokenSTRINGshall represent a string constant. A string\n           constant shall begin with the character'\"'.  Within a string\n           constant, a <backslash> character shall be considered to\n           begin an escape sequence as specified in the table in the\n           Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\u20102017,Chapter 5,FileFormat Notation('\\\\','\\a','\\b','\\f','\\n','\\r','\\t','\\v').  In addition, the escape sequences inTable 4-2,Escape Sequences in awkshall be recognized. A <newline>\n           shall not occur within a string constant. A string constant\n           shall be terminated by the first unescaped occurrence of the\n           character'\"'after the one that begins the string constant.\n           The value of the string shall be the sequence of all\n           unescaped characters and values of escape sequences between,\n           but not including, the two delimiting'\"'characters.\n\n        6. The tokenERErepresents an extended regular expression\n           constant. An ERE constant shall begin with the <slash>\n           character. Within an ERE constant, a <backslash> character\n           shall be considered to begin an escape sequence as specified\n           in the table in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\u20102017,Chapter 5,File Format Notation.  In addition, the escape\n           sequences inTable 4-2, Escape Sequences in awkshall be\n           recognized. The application shall ensure that a <newline>\n           does not occur within an ERE constant. An ERE constant shall\n           be terminated by the first unescaped occurrence of the\n           <slash> character after the one that begins the ERE constant.\n           The extended regular expression represented by the ERE\n           constant shall be the sequence of all unescaped characters\n           and values of escape sequences between, but not including,\n           the two delimiting <slash> characters.\n\n        7. A <blank> shall have no effect, except to delimit lexical\n           tokens or withinSTRINGorEREtokens.\n\n        8. The tokenNUMBERshall represent a numeric constant. Its form\n           and numeric value shall either be equivalent to thedecimal-floating-constanttoken as specified by the ISO C standard,\n           or it shall be a sequence of decimal digits and shall be\n           evaluated as an integer constant in decimal. In addition,\n           implementations may accept numeric constants with the form\n           and numeric value equivalent to thehexadecimal-constantandhexadecimal-floating-constanttokens as specified by the\n           ISO C standard.\n\n           If the value is too large or too small to be representable\n           (seeSection 1.1.2,Concepts Derived from the ISO CStandard), the behavior is undefined.\n\n        9. A sequence of underscores, digits, and alphabetics from the\n           portable character set (see the Base Definitions volume of\n           POSIX.1\u20102017,Section 6.1,Portable Character Set), beginning\n           with an <underscore> or alphabetic character, shall be\n           considered a word.\n\n       10. The following words are keywords that shall be recognized as\n           individual tokens; the name of the token is the same as the\n           keyword:BEGIN      delete     END        function   in         printfbreak      do         exit       getline    next       returncontinue   else       for        if         print      while11.

        "rationale": "This description is based on the newawk, ``nawk'', (see the\n       referencedThe AWK Programming Language), which introduced a\n       number of new features to the historicalawk:\n\n        1. New keywords:delete,do,function,return2. New built-in functions:atan2,close,cos,gsub,match,rand,sin,srand,sub,system3. New predefined variables:FNR,ARGC,ARGV,RSTART,RLENGTH,SUBSEP4. New expression operators:?,:,,,^5. TheFSvariable and the third argument tosplit, now treated\n           as extended regular expressions.\n\n        6. The operator precedence, changed to more closely match the C\n           language.  Two examples of code that operate differently are:\n\n               while ( n /= 10 > 1) ...\n               if (!\"wk\" ~ /bwk/) ...\n\n       Several features have been added based on newer implementations\n       ofawk:\n\n        *  Multiple instances of-fprogfileare permitted.\n\n        *  The new option-vassignment.*  The new predefined variableENVIRON.\n\n        *  New built-in functionstoupperandtolower.\n\n        *  More formatting capabilities are added toprintfto match the\n           ISO C standard.\n\n       Earlier versions of this standard required implementations to\n       support multiple adjacent <semicolon>s, lines with one or more\n       <semicolon> before a rule (pattern-actionpairs), and lines with\n       only <semicolon>(s).  These are not required by this standard and\n       are considered poor programming practice, but can be accepted by\n       an implementation ofawkas an extension.\n\n       The overallawksyntax has always been based on the C language,\n       with a few features from the shell command language and other\n       sources. Because of this, it is not completely compatible with\n       any other language, which has caused confusion for some users. It\n       is not the intent of the standard developers to address such\n       issues. A few relatively minor changes toward making the language\n       more compatible with the ISO C standard were made; most of these\n       changes are based on similar changes in recent implementations,\n       as described above. There remain several C-language conventions\n       that are not inawk.  One of the notable ones is the <comma>\n       operator, which is commonly used to specify multiple expressions\n       in the C languageforstatement. Also, there are various places\n       whereawkis more restrictive than the C language regarding the\n       type of expression that can be used in a given context. These\n       limitations are due to the different features that theawklanguage does provide.\n\n       Regular expressions inawkhave been extended somewhat from\n       historical implementations to make them a pure superset of\n       extended regular expressions, as defined by POSIX.1\u20102008 (see the\n       Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1\u20102017,Section 9.4,ExtendedRegular Expressions).  The main extensions are\n       internationalization features and interval expressions.\n       Historical implementations ofawkhave long supported\n       <backslash>-escape sequences as an extension to extended regular\n       expressions, and this extension has been retained despite\n       inconsistency with other utilities. The number of escape\n       sequences recognized in both extended regular expressions and\n       strings has varied (generally increasing with time) among\n       implementations. The set specified by POSIX.1\u20102008 includes most\n       sequences known to be supported by popular implementations and by\n       the ISO C standard. One sequence that is not supported is\n       hexadecimal value escapes beginning with'\\x'.  This would allow\n       values expressed in more than 9 bits to be used withinawkas in\n       the ISO C standard. However, because this syntax has a non-\n       deterministic length, it does not permit the subsequent character\n       to be a hexadecimal digit. This limitation can be dealt with in\n       the C language by the use of lexical string concatenation. In theawklanguage, concatenation could also be a solution for strings,\n       but not for extended regular expressions (either lexical ERE\n       tokens or strings used dynamically as regular expressions).\n       Because of this limitation, the feature has not been added to\n       POSIX.1\u20102008.\n\n       When a string variable is used in a context where an extended\n       regular expression normally appears (where the lexical token ERE\n       is used in the grammar) the string does not contain the literal\n       <slash> characters.\n\n       Some versions ofawkallow the form:\n\n           func name(args, ... ) { statements }\n\n       This has been deprecated by the authors of the language, who\n       asked that it not be specified.\n\n       Historical implementations ofawkproduce an error if anextstatement is executed in aBEGINaction, and causeawkto\n       terminate if anextstatement is executed in anENDaction. This\n       behavior has not been documented, and it was not believed that it\n       was necessary to standardize it.\n\n       The specification of conversions between string and numeric\n       values is much more detailed than in the documentation of\n       historical implementations or in the referencedThe AWKProgramming Language. Although most of the behavior is designed\n       to be intuitive, the details are necessary to ensure compatible\n       behavior from different implementations. This is especially\n       important in relational expressions since the types of the\n       operands determine whether a string or numeric comparison is\n       performed. From the perspective of an application developer, it\n       is usually sufficient to expect intuitive behavior and to force\n       conversions (by adding zero or concatenating a null string) when\n       the type of an expression does not obviously match what is\n       needed. The intent has been to specify historical practice in\n       almost all cases. The one exception is that, in historical\n       implementations, variables and constants maintain both string and\n       numeric values after their original value is converted by any\n       use. This means that referencing a variable or constant can have\n       unexpected side-effects. For example, with historical\n       implementations the following program:\n\n           {\n               a = \"+2\"\n               b = 2\n               if (NR % 2)\n                   c = a + b\n               if (a == b)\n                   print \"numeric comparison\"\n               else\n                   print \"string comparison\"\n           }\n\n       would perform a numeric comparison (and output numeric\n       comparison) for each odd-numbered line, but perform a string\n       comparison (and output string comparison) for each even-numbered\n       line. POSIX.1\u20102008 ensures that comparisons will be numeric if\n       necessary. With historical implementations, the following\n       program:\n\n           BEGIN {\n               OFMT = \"%e\"\n               print 3.14\n               OFMT = \"%f\"\n               print 3.14\n           }\n\n       would output\"3.140000e+00\"twice, because in the secondprintstatement the constant\"3.14\"would have a string value from the\n       previous conversion. POSIX.1\u20102008 requires that the output of the\n       secondprintstatement be\"3.140000\".  The behavior of historical\n       implementations was seen as too unintuitive and unpredictable.\n\n       It was pointed out that with the rules contained in early drafts,\n       the following script would print nothing:\n\n           BEGIN {\n               y[1.5] = 1\n               OFMT = \"%e\"\n               print y[1.5]\n           }\n\n       Therefore, a new variable,CONVFMT, was introduced. TheOFMTvariable is now restricted to affecting output conversions of\n       numbers to strings andCONVFMTis used for internal conversions,\n       such as comparisons or array indexing. The default value is the\n       same as that forOFMT, so unless a program changesCONVFMT(which\n       no historical program would do), it will receive the historical\n       behavior associated with internal string conversions.\n\n       The POSIXawklexical and syntactic conventions are specified\n       more formally than in other sources. Again the intent has been to\n       specify historical practice. One convention that may not be\n       obvious from the formal grammar as in other verbal descriptions\n       is where <newline> characters are acceptable. There are several\n       obvious placements such as terminating a statement, and a\n       <backslash> can be used to escape <newline> characters between\n       any lexical tokens. In addition, <newline> characters without\n       <backslash> characters can follow a comma, an open brace, a\n       logical AND operator (\"&&\"), a logical OR operator (\"||\"), thedokeyword, theelsekeyword, and the closing parenthesis of anif,for, orwhilestatement. For example:\n\n           { print $1,\n                   $2 }\n\n       The requirement thatawkadd a trailing <newline> to the program\n       argument text is to simplify the grammar, making it match a text\n       file in form. There is no way for an application or test suite to\n       determine whether a literal <newline> is added or whetherawksimply acts as if it did.\n\n       POSIX.1\u20102008 requires several changes from historical\n       implementations in order to support internationalization.\n       Probably the most subtle of these is the use of the decimal-point\n       character, defined by theLC_NUMERICcategory of the locale, in\n       representations of floating-point numbers.  This locale-specific\n       character is used in recognizing numeric input, in converting\n       between strings and numeric values, and in formatting output.\n       However, regardless of locale, the <period> character (the\n       decimal-point character of the POSIX locale) is the decimal-point\n       character recognized in processingawkprograms (including\n       assignments in command line arguments). This is essentially the\n       same convention as the one used in the ISO C standard. The\n       difference is that the C language includes thesetlocale()\n       function, which permits an application to modify its locale.\n       Because of this capability, a C application begins executing with\n       its locale set to the C locale, and only executes in the\n       environment-specified locale after an explicit call tosetlocale().  However, adding such an elaborate new feature to\n       theawklanguage was seen as inappropriate for POSIX.1\u20102008. It\n       is possible to execute anawkprogram explicitly in any desired\n       locale by setting the environment in the shell.\n\n       The undefined behavior resulting from NULs in extended regular\n       expressions allows future extensions for the GNUgawkprogram to\n       process binary data.\n\n       The behavior in the case of invalidawkprograms (including\n       lexical, syntactic, and semantic errors) is undefined because it\n       was considered overly limiting on implementations to specify. In\n       most cases such errors can be expected to produce a diagnostic\n       and a non-zero exit status. However, some implementations may\n       choose to extend the language in ways that make use of certain\n       invalid constructs. Other invalid constructs might be deemed\n       worthy of a warning, but otherwise cause some reasonable\n       behavior. Still other constructs may be very difficult to detect\n       in some implementations.  Also, different implementations might\n       detect a given error during an initial parsing of the program\n       (before reading any input files) while others might detect it\n       when executing the program after reading some input. Implementors\n       should be aware that diagnosing errors as early as possible and\n       producing useful diagnostics can ease debugging of applications,\n       and thus make an implementation more usable.\n\n       The unspecified behavior from using multi-characterRSvalues is\n       to allow possible future extensions based on extended regular\n       expressions used for record separators. Historical\n       implementations take the first character of the string and ignore\n       the others.\n\n       Unspecified behavior whensplit(string,array,<null>) is used is\n       to allow a proposed future extension that would split up a string\n       into an array of individual characters.\n\n       In the context of thegetlinefunction, equally good arguments\n       for different precedences of the|and<operators can be made.\n       Historical practice has been that:\n\n           getline < \"a\" \"b\"\n\n       is parsed as:\n\n           ( getline < \"a\" ) \"b\"\n\n       although many would argue that the intent was that the fileabshould be read. However:\n\n           getline < \"x\" + 1\n\n       parses as:\n\n           getline < ( \"x\" + 1 )\n\n       Similar problems occur with the|version ofgetline,\n       particularly in combination with$.  For example:\n\n           $\"echo hi\" | getline\n\n       (This situation is particularly problematic when used in aprintstatement, where the|getlinepart might be a redirection of theprint.)\n\n       Since in most cases such constructs are not (or at least should\n       not) be used (because they have a natural ambiguity for which\n       there is no conventional parsing), the meaning of these\n       constructs has been made explicitly unspecified. (The effect is\n       that a conforming application that runs into the problem must\n       parenthesize to resolve the ambiguity.)  There appeared to be few\n       if any actual uses of such constructs.\n\n       Grammars can be written that would cause an error under these\n       circumstances. Where backwards-compatibility is not a large\n       consideration, implementors may wish to use such grammars.\n\n       Some historical implementations have allowed some built-in\n       functions to be called without an argument list, the result being\n       a default argument list chosen in some ``reasonable'' way. Use oflengthas a synonym forlength($0)is the only one of these forms\n       that is thought to be widely known or widely used; this\n       particular form is documented in various places (for example,\n       most historicalawkreference pages, although not in the\n       referencedThe AWK Programming Language) as legitimate practice.\n       With this exception, default argument lists have always been\n       undocumented and vaguely defined, and it is not at all clear how\n       (or if) they should be generalized to user-defined functions.\n       They add no useful functionality and preclude possible future\n       extensions that might need to name functions without calling\n       them. Not standardizing them seems the simplest course. The\n       standard developers considered thatlengthmerited special\n       treatment, however, since it has been documented in the past and\n       sees possibly substantial use in historical programs.\n       Accordingly, this usage has been made legitimate, but Issue 5\n       removed the obsolescent marking for XSI-conforming\n       implementations and many otherwise conforming applications depend\n       on this feature.\n\n       Insubandgsub, ifreplis a string literal (the lexical tokenSTRING), then two consecutive <backslash> characters should be\n       used in the string to ensure a single <backslash> will precede\n       the <ampersand> when the resultant string is passed to the\n       function. (For example, to specify one literal <ampersand> in the\n       replacement string, usegsub(ERE,\"\\\\&\").)\n\n       Historically, the only special character in thereplargument ofsubandgsubstring functions was the <ampersand> ('&') character\n       and preceding it with the <backslash> character was used to turn\n       off its special meaning.\n\n       The description in the ISO POSIX\u20102:1993 standard introduced\n       behavior such that the <backslash> character was another special\n       character and it was unspecified whether there were any other\n       special characters. This description introduced several\n       portability problems, some of which are described below, and so\n       it has been replaced with the more historical description. Some\n       of the problems include:\n\n        *  Historically, to create the replacement string, a script\n           could usegsub(ERE,\"\\\\&\"), but with the ISO POSIX\u20102:1993\n           standard wording, it was necessary to usegsub(ERE,\"\\\\\\\\&\").\n           The <backslash> characters are doubled here because all\n           string literals are subject to lexical analysis, which would\n           reduce each pair of <backslash> characters to a single\n           <backslash> before being passed togsub.\n\n        *  Since it was unspecified what the special characters were,\n           for portable scripts to guarantee that characters are printed\n           literally, each character had to be preceded with a\n           <backslash>.  (For example, a portable script had to usegsub(ERE,\"\\\\h\\\\i\") to produce a replacement string of\"hi\".)\n\n       The description for comparisons in the ISO POSIX\u20102:1993 standard\n       did not properly describe historical practice because of the way\n       numeric strings are compared as numbers. The current rules cause\n       the following code:\n\n           if (0 == \"000\")\n               print \"strange, but true\"\n           else\n               print \"not true\"\n\n       to do a numeric comparison, causing theifto succeed. It should\n       be intuitively obvious that this is incorrect behavior, and\n       indeed, no historical implementation ofawkactually behaves this\n       way.\n\n       To fix this problem, the definition ofnumeric stringwas\n       enhanced to include only those values obtained from specific\n       circumstances (mostly external sources) where it is not possible\n       to determine unambiguously whether the value is intended to be a\n       string or a numeric.\n\n       Variables that are assigned to a numeric string shall also be\n       treated as a numeric string. (For example, the notion of a\n       numeric string can be propagated across assignments.) In\n       comparisons, all variables having the uninitialized value are to\n       be treated as a numeric operand evaluating to the numeric value\n       zero.\n\n       Uninitialized variables include all types of variables including\n       scalars, array elements, and fields. The definition of an\n       uninitialized value inVariables and Special Variablesis\n       necessary to describe the value placed on uninitialized variables\n       and on fields that are valid (for example,< $NF) but have no\n       characters in them and to describe how these variables are to be\n       used in comparisons. A valid field, such as$1, that has no\n       characters in it can be obtained from an input line of\"\\t\\t\"whenFS='\\t'.  Historically, the comparison ($1<10) was done\n       numerically after evaluating$1to the value zero.\n\n       The phrase ``... also shall have the numeric value of the numeric\n       string'' was removed from several sections of the\n       ISO POSIX\u20102:1993 standard because is specifies an unnecessary\n       implementation detail. It is not necessary for POSIX.1\u20102008 to\n       specify that these objects be assigned two different values.  It\n       is only necessary to specify that these objects may evaluate to\n       two different values depending on context.\n\n       Historical implementations ofawkdid not parse hexadecimal\n       integer or floating constants like\"0xa\"and\"0xap0\".  Due to an\n       oversight, the 2001 through 2004 editions of this standard\n       required support for hexadecimal floating constants. This was due\n       to the reference toatof().  This version of the standard allows\n       but does not require implementations to useatof() and includes a\n       description of how floating-point numbers are recognized as an\n       alternative to match historic behavior. The intent of this change\n       is to allow implementations to recognize floating-point constants\n       according to either the ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard or\n       ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard, and to allow (but not require)\n       implementations to recognize hexadecimal integer constants.\n\n       Historical implementations ofawkdid not support floating-point\n       infinities and NaNs innumeric strings; e.g.,\"-INF\"and\"NaN\".\n       However, implementations that use theatof() orstrtod()\n       functions to do the conversion picked up support for these values\n       if they used a ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard version of the function\n       instead of a ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard version. Due to an\n       oversight, the 2001 through 2004 editions of this standard did\n       not allow support for infinities and NaNs, but in this revision\n       support is allowed (but not required). This is a silent change to\n       the behavior ofawkprograms; for example, in the POSIX locale\n       the expression:\n\n           (\"-INF\" + 0 < 0)\n\n       formerly had the value 0 because\"-INF\"converted to 0, but now\n       it may have the value 0 or 1.",
        "future_directions": "A future version of this standard may require the\"!=\"and\"==\"operators to perform string comparisons by checking if the\n       strings are identical (and not by checking if they collate\n       equally).",

See \u201cCreate implicit components from options\u201d to\n       learn how to enable them.\n\n       If you need another trace processing graph layout, use the more\n       flexiblebabeltrace2-run(1)command.\n\n       Like with thebabeltrace2-run(1)command, you can create\n       components explicitly with the--componentoption (see \u201cCreate\n       explicit components\u201d). You can also use one of the many specificconvertcommand options (see \u201cCreate implicit components from\n       options\u201d) and non-option arguments (see \u201cCreate implicit\n       components from non-option arguments\u201d) to create implicit\n       components.\n\n       Animplicit componentis a component which is created and added\n       to the conversion graph without an explicit instantiation through\n       the--componentoption. An implicit component is easier to create\n       than an explicit component: this is why theconvertcommand\n       exists, as you can also create and run a conversion graph with\n       the genericbabeltrace2-run(1)command.\n\n       For example, you can specify one or more CTF trace path as\n       non-option arguments to pretty-print the merged events to the\n       standard output:\n\n           $ babeltrace2 /path/to/trace /path/to/other/trace\n\n       This is the equivalent of creating and connecting together:\n\n       \u2022   Onesource.ctf.fscomponents with itsinputsinitialization\n           parameter set to/path/to/trace.\n\n       \u2022   Onesource.ctf.fscomponents with itsinputsinitialization\n           parameter set to/path/to/other/trace.\n\n       \u2022   Afilter.utils.muxercomponent.\n\n       \u2022   Asink.text.prettycomponent.\n\n       This creates the following conversion graph:\n\n           +------------+    +-----------------+    +------------------+\n           | src.ctf.fs |    | flt.utils.muxer |    | sink.text.pretty |\n           |  [ctf-fs]  |    |     [muxer]     |    |     [pretty]     |\n           |            |    |                 |    |                  |\n           |    stream0 @--->@ in0         out @--->@ in               |\n           |    stream1 @--->@ in1             |    +------------------+\n           |    stream2 @--->@ in2             |\n           |    stream3 @--->@ in3             |\n           +------------+    |                 |\n                             |                 |\n           +------------+    |                 |\n           | src.ctf.fs |    |                 |\n           | [ctf-fs-2] |    |                 |\n           |            |    |                 |\n           |    stream0 @--->@ in4             |\n           |    stream1 @--->@ in5             |\n           +------------+    @ in6             |\n                             +-----------------+\n\n       It is equivalent to the followingbabeltrace2-run(1)command\n       line:\n\n           $ babeltrace2 run --component=ctf-fs:src.ctf.fs \\\n                             --params='inputs=[\"/path/to/trace\"] \\\n                             --component=ctf-fs-2:src.ctf.fs \\\n                             --params='inputs=[\"/path/to/other/trace\"] \\\n                             --component=muxer:filter.utils.muxer \\\n                             --component=pretty:sink.text.pretty \\\n                             --connect=ctf*:muxer --connect=muxer:pretty\n\n       You can use the--run-argsoption to make theconvertcommand\n       print its equivalentruncommand arguments instead of creating\n       and running the conversion graph. The printed arguments are\n       escaped for shells, which means you can use them as is on the\n       command line and possibly add more options to theruncommand:\n\n           $ babeltrace2 run $(babeltrace2 --run-args /path/to/trace) ...\n\n       The--run-args-0option is like the--run-argsoption, but the\n       printed arguments are NOT escaped and they are separated by a\n       null character instead of a space. This is useful if the\n       resulting arguments are not the direct input of a shell, for\n       example if passed toxargs -0.\n\n       See \u201cEXAMPLES\u201d for usage examples.Create explicit componentsTo explicitly create a component, use the--componentoption.\n       This option specifies:\n\n       \u2022Optional: The name of the component.\n\n       \u2022   The type of the component class to instantiate: source,\n           filter, or sink.\n\n       \u2022   The name of the plugin in which to find the component class\n           to instantiate.\n\n       \u2022   The name of the component class to instantiate.\n\n       You can use the--componentoption multiple times to create\n       multiple components. You can instantiate the same component class\n       multiple times as different component instances.\n\n       Immediately following a--componentoption on the command line,\n       the created component is known as thecurrent component(until\n       the next--componentoption or non-option argument).\n\n       The following command-line options apply to the current\n       component:--log-level=LVLSet the log level of the current component toLVL.--params=PARAMSAddPARAMSto the initialization parameters of the current\n           component.\n\n           IfPARAMScontains a key which exists in the current\n           component\u2019s initialization parameters, replace the parameter.\n\n       See \u201cEXAMPLES\u201d for usage examples.Create implicit components from non-option argumentsWhen you specify a non-option argument to theconvertcommand, it\n       tries to find one or more components which can handle this\n       argument.\n\n       For example, with this command line:\n\n           $ babeltrace2 /path/to/trace\n\n       If/path/to/traceis a CTF trace directory, then theconvertcommand creates asource.ctf.fscomponent to handle this specific\n       trace.\n\n       This automatic source component discovery mechanism is possible\n       thanks to component classes which support thebabeltrace.support-infoquery object (seebabeltrace2-query-babeltrace.support-info(7)).\n\n       The non-option argument can be a directory. If no component can\n       handle that specific directory, then theconvertcommand\n       traverses that directory and recursively tries to find compatible\n       components for each file and subdirectory. This means that a\n       single non-option argument can lead to the creation of many\n       implicit components.\n\n       The following command-line options apply to ALL the implicit\n       components created from the last non-option argument:--log-level=LVLSet the log level of those implicit components toLVL.--params=PARAMSAddPARAMSto the initialization parameters of those implicit\n           components.\n\n           For a given implicit component, ifPARAMScontains a key\n           which exists in this component\u2019s initialization parameters,\n           replace the parameter.\n\n       Note that it\u2019s also possible for two non-option arguments to\n       cause the creation of a single implicit component. For example,\n       if you specify:\n\n           $ babeltrace2 /path/to/chunk1 /path/to/chunk2\n\n       where/path/to/chunk1and/path/to/chunk2are paths to chunks of\n       the same logical CTF trace, then theconvertcommand creates a\n       singlesource.ctf.fscomponent which receives both paths at\n       initialization time. When this happens, any--log-levelor--paramsoption that you specify to one of them applies to the\n       single implicit component. For example:\n\n           $ babeltrace2 /path/to/chunk1 --params=clock-class-offset-s=450 \\\n                         /path/to/chunk2 --params=clock-class-offset-ns=98 \\\n                         --log-level=INFO\n\n       Here, the single implicit component gets bothclock-class-offset-sandclock-class-offset-nsinitialization parameters, as well as\n       the INFO log level.\n\n       For backward compatibility with thebabeltrace(1) program, theconvertcommand ignores any non-option argument which does not\n       cause the creation of any component. In that case, it emits a\n       warning log statement and continues.Create implicit components from optionsThere are many ways to create implicit components from options\n       with theconvertcommand:\n\n       \u2022   To create an implicitfilter.utils.trimmercomponent (stream\n           trimmer), specify the--begin,--end, or--timerangeoption.\n\n           Examples:\n\n               $ babeltrace2 /path/to/trace --begin=22:14:38 --end=22:15:07\n\n               $ babeltrace2 /path/to/trace --timerange=22:14:38,22:15:07\n\n               $ babeltrace2 /path/to/trace --end=12:31:04.882928015\n\n       \u2022   To create an implicitfilter.lttng-utils.debug-info(add\n           debugging information to compatible LTTng events), specify\n           any of the--debug-info,--debug-info-dir,--debug-info-full-path, or--debug-info-target-prefixoptions.\n\n           Examples:\n\n               $ babeltrace2 /path/to/trace --debug-info\n\n               $ babeltrace2 /path/to/trace \\\n                             --debug-info-target-prefix=/tmp/tgt-root\n\n               $ babeltrace2 /path/to/trace --debug-info-full-path\n\n       \u2022   To create an implicitsink.text.prettycomponent\n           (pretty-printing text output to the standard output or to a\n           file), specify no other sink components, explicit or\n           implicit.\n\n           The implicitsink.text.prettycomponent exists by default. If\n           any other explicit or implicit sink component exists, theconvertcommand does not automatically create the implicitsink.text.prettycomponent.\n\n           The--clock-cycles,--clock-date,--clock-gmt,--clock-seconds,--color,--fields,--names, and--no-deltaoptions\n           all apply to the implicitsink.text.prettycomponent.\n\n           The--outputoption without--output-format=ctfmakes the\n           implicitsink.text.prettycomponent write its content to a\n           file, except the warnings for backward compatibility with thebabeltrace(1) program.\n\n           Examples:\n\n               $ babeltrace2 /path/to/trace\n\n               $ babeltrace2 /path/to/trace --no-delta\n\n               $ babeltrace2 /path/to/trace --output=/tmp/pretty-out\n\n       \u2022   To create an implicitsink.utils.dummycomponent (no output),\n           specify the--output-format=dummyoption.\n\n           Example:\n\n               $ babeltrace2 /path/to/trace --output-format=dummy\n\n       \u2022   To create an implicitsink.ctf.fscomponent (CTF traces\n           written to the file system), specify the--output-format=ctfand the--output=DIR(base output directory) options.\n\n           Example:\n\n               $ babeltrace2 /path/to/input/trace --output-format=ctf \\\n                             --output=my-traces\n\n       You can combine multiple methods to create multiple implicit\n       components. For example, you can trim an LTTng (CTF) trace, add\n       debugging information to it, and write it as another CTF trace:\n\n           $ babeltrace2 /path/to/input/trace --timerange=22:14:38,22:15:07 \\\n                         --debug-info --output-format=ctf --output=out-dir\n\n       The equivalentbabeltrace2-run(1)command of thisconvertcommand\n       is:\n\n           $ babeltrace2 run --component=auto-disc-source-ctf-fs:source.ctf.fs \\\n                             --params='inputs=[\"/path/to/input/trace\"]' \\\n                             --component=sink-ctf-fs:sink.ctf.fs \\\n                             --params='path=\"out-dir\"' \\\n                             --component=muxer:filter.utils.muxer \\\n                             --component=trimmer:filter.utils.trimmer \\\n                             --params='begin=\"22:14:38\"' \\\n                             --params='end=\"22:15:07\"' \\\n                             --component=debug-info:filter.lttng-utils.debug-info \\\n                             --connect=auto-disc-source-ctf-fs:muxer \\\n                             --connect=muxer:trimmer \\\n                             --connect=trimmer:debug-info \\\n                             --connect=debug-info:sink-ctf-fs\n\n       The order of the implicit component options documented in this\n       subsection is not significant.\n\n       See \u201cEXAMPLES\u201d for more examples.",

When you specify a--componentoption, its\n       initial initialization parameters are a copy of the current base\n       initialization parameters.\n\n       Immediately following a--componentoption on the command line,\n       the created component is known as thecurrent component(until\n       the next--componentoption).\n\n       The--params=PARAMSoption adds parameters to the current\n       component\u2019s initialization parameters. IfPARAMScontains a key\n       which exists in the current component\u2019s initialization\n       parameters, this parameter is replaced.Connect componentsThe components which you create from component classes with the--componentoption (see \u201cCreate components\u201d) add input and outputportsdepending on their type. An output port is from where\n       messages, like trace events, are sent. An input port is where\n       messages are received. For a given component, each port has a\n       unique name.\n\n       The purpose of theruncommand is to create a trace processing\n       graph, that is, to know which component ports to connect\n       together. The command achieves this with the help of the\n       connection rules that you provide with one or more--connect=CONN-RULEoptions.\n\n       The format ofCONN-RULEis:UP-COMP-PAT[.UP-PORT-PAT]:DOWN-COMP-PAT[.DOWN-PORT-PAT]UP-COMP-PATUpstream component name pattern.UP-PORT-PATUpstream (output) port name pattern.DOWN-COMP-PATDownstream component name pattern.DOWN-PORT-PATDownstream (input) port name pattern.\n\n       When a source or filter component adds a new output port within\n       the processing graph, theruncommand does the following to find\n       an input port to connect it to:\n\n           For each connection rule (--connect options, in order):\n             If the output port's component's name matches UP-COMP-PAT and the\n             output port's name matches UP-PORT-PAT:\n               For each component COMP in the trace processing graph:\n                 If the name of COMP matches DOWN-COMP-PAT:\n                   Select the first input port of COMP of which the name matches\n                   DOWN-PORT-PAT, or fail with no match.\n\n           No possible connection: fail with no match.UP-COMP-PAT,UP-PORT-PAT,DOWN-COMP-PAT, andDOWN-PORT-PATare\n       globbing patterns where only the wildcard character,*, is\n       special: it matches zero or more characters. You must escape the*,?,[,.,:, and\\characters with\\.\n\n       When you do not specifyUP-PORT-PATorDOWN-PORT-PAT, they are\n       equivalent to*.\n\n       You can leverage this connection mechanism to specify fallbacks\n       with a careful use of wildcards, as the order of the--connectoptions on the command line is significant. For example:\n\n           --connect='A.out*:B.in*' --connect=A:B --connect='*:C'\n\n       With those connection rules, theruncommand connects:\n\n       \u2022   Any output port of which the name starts withoutof\n           componentAto the first input port of which the name starts\n           withinof componentB.\n\n       \u2022   Any other output port of componentAto the first available\n           input port of componentB.\n\n       \u2022   Any other output port (of any component exceptA) to the\n           first available input port of componentC.\n\n       Theruncommand fails when it cannot find an input port to which\n       to connect a given output port using the provided connection\n       rules.\n\n       See \u201cEXAMPLES\u201d for more examples.",

shall be as follows:\n\n        1. Except as noted,bcshall recognize the longest possible\n           token or delimiter beginning at a given point.\n\n        2. A comment shall consist of any characters beginning with the\n           two adjacent characters\"/*\"and terminated by the next\n           occurrence of the two adjacent characters\"*/\".  Comments\n           shall have no effect except to delimit lexical tokens.\n\n        3. The <newline> shall be recognized as the tokenNEWLINE.\n\n        4. The tokenSTRINGshall represent a string constant; it shall\n           consist of any characters beginning with the double-quote\n           character ('\"') and terminated by another occurrence of the\n           double-quote character. The value of the string is the\n           sequence of all characters between, but not including, the\n           two double-quote characters. All characters shall be taken\n           literally from the input, and there is no way to specify a\n           string containing a double-quote character. The length of the\n           value of each string shall be limited to {BC_STRING_MAX}\n           bytes.\n\n        5. A <blank> shall have no effect except as an ordinary\n           character if it appears within aSTRINGtoken, or to delimit\n           a lexical token other thanSTRING.\n\n        6. The combination of a <backslash> character immediately\n           followed by a <newline> shall have no effect other than to\n           delimit lexical tokens with the following exceptions:\n\n            *  It shall be interpreted as the character sequence\"\\<newline>\"inSTRINGtokens.\n\n            *  It shall be ignored as part of a multi-lineNUMBERtoken.\n\n        7. The tokenNUMBERshall represent a numeric constant. It shall\n           be recognized by the following grammar:\n\n               NUMBER  : integer\n                       | '.' integer\n                       | integer '.'\n                       | integer '.' integer\n                       ;\n\n               integer : digit\n                       | integer digit\n                       ;\n\n               digit   : 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7\n                       | 8 | 9 | A | B | C | D | E | F\n                       ;\n\n        8. The value of aNUMBERtoken shall be interpreted as a numeral\n           in the base specified by the value of the internal registeribase(described below). Each of thedigitcharacters shall\n           have the value from 0 to 15 in the order listed here, and the\n           <period> character shall represent the radix point. The\n           behavior is undefined if digits greater than or equal to the\n           value ofibaseappear in the token. However, note the\n           exception for single-digit values being assigned toibaseandobasethemselves, inOperations in bc.\n\n        9. The following keywords shall be recognized as tokens:auto     ibase    length   return   whilebreak    if       obase    scaledefine   for      quit     sqrt10. Any of the following characters occurring anywhere except\n           within a keyword shall be recognized as the tokenLETTER:\n\n               a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n\n       11. The following single-character and two-character sequences\n           shall be recognized as the tokenASSIGN_OP:\n\n               =   +=   -=   *=   /=   %=   ^=\n\n       12. If an'='character, as the beginning of a token, is followed\n           by a'-'character with no intervening delimiter, the\n           behavior is undefined.\n\n       13. The following single-characters shall be recognized as the\n           tokenMUL_OP:\n\n               *   /   %\n\n       14. The following single-character and two-character sequences\n           shall be recognized as the tokenREL_OP:\n\n               ==   <=   >=   !=   <   >\n\n       15.

The following single characters shall be recognized as tokens\n           whose names are the character:\n\n               <newline>  (  )  ,  +  -  ;  [  ]  ^  {  }\n\n       17. The tokenEOFis returned when the end of input is reached.Operations in bcThere are three kinds of identifiers: ordinary identifiers, array\n       identifiers, and function identifiers.  All three types consist\n       of single lowercase letters. Array identifiers shall be followed\n       by square brackets (\"[]\").  An array subscript is required except\n       in an argument or auto list.  Arrays are singly dimensioned and\n       can contain up to {BC_DIM_MAX} elements. Indexing shall begin at\n       zero so an array is indexed from 0 to {BC_DIM_MAX}-1.  Subscripts\n       shall be truncated to integers. The application shall ensure that\n       function identifiers are followed by parentheses, possibly\n       enclosing arguments.

Named\n       expressions shall be valid on the left side of an assignment. The\n       value of a named expression shall be the value stored in the\n       place named. Simple identifiers and array elements are named\n       expressions; they have an initial value of zero and an initial\n       scale of zero.\n\n       The internal registersscale,ibase, andobaseare all named\n       expressions. The scale of an expression consisting of the name of\n       one of these registers shall be zero; values assigned to any of\n       these registers are truncated to integers. Thescaleregister\n       shall contain a global value used in computing the scale of\n       expressions (as described below). The value of the registerscaleis limited to 0 \u2264scale\u2264 {BC_SCALE_MAX} and shall have a default\n       value of zero.

When an exact result is not achieved (for\n       example,scale=0; 3.2/1),the result shall be truncated.\n\n       For all values ofobasespecified by this volume of POSIX.1\u20102017,bcshall output numeric values by performing each of the\n       following steps in order:\n\n        1. If the value is less than zero, a <hyphen-minus> ('-')\n           character shall be output.\n\n        2. One of the following is output, depending on the numerical\n           value:\n\n            *  If the absolute value of the numerical value is greater\n               than or equal to one, the integer portion of the value\n               shall be output as a series of digits appropriate toobase(as described below), most significant digit first.\n               The most significant non-zero digit shall be output next,\n               followed by each successively less significant digit.\n\n            *  If the absolute value of the numerical value is less than\n               one but greater than zero and the scale of the numerical\n               value is greater than zero, it is unspecified whether the\n               character 0 is output.\n\n            *  If the numerical value is zero, the character 0 shall be\n               output.\n\n        3. If the scale of the value is greater than zero and the\n           numeric value is not zero, a <period> character shall be\n           output, followed by a series of digits appropriate toobase(as described below) representing the most significant\n           portion of the fractional part of the value. Ifsrepresents\n           the scale of the value being output, the number of digits\n           output shall besifobaseis 10, less than or equal tosifobaseis greater than 10, or greater than or equal tosifobaseis less than 10. Forobasevalues other than 10, this\n           should be the number of digits needed to represent a\n           precision of 10s.\n\n       Forobasevalues from 2 to 16, valid digits are the firstobaseof the single characters:\n\n           0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F\n\n       which represent the values zero to 15, inclusive, respectively.\n\n       For bases greater than 16, each digit shall be written as a\n       separate multi-digit decimal number. Each digit except the most\n       significant fractional digit shall be preceded by a single\n       <space>.  For bases from 17 to 100,bcshall write two-digit\n       decimal numbers; for bases from 101 to 1000, three-digit decimal\n       strings, and so on. For example, the decimal number 1024 in base\n       25 would be written as:\n\n            01 15 24\n\n       and in base 125, as:\n\n            008 024\n\n       Very large numbers shall be split across lines with 70 characters\n       per line in the POSIX locale; other locales may split at\n       different character boundaries. Lines that are continued shall\n       end with a <backslash>.\n\n       A function call shall consist of a function name followed by\n       parentheses containing a <comma>-separated list of expressions,\n       which are the function arguments. A whole array passed as an\n       argument shall be specified by the array name followed by empty\n       square brackets. All function arguments shall be passed by value.\n       As a result, changes made to the formal parameters shall have no\n       effect on the actual arguments. If the function terminates by\n       executing areturnstatement, the value of the function shall be\n       the value of the expression in the parentheses of thereturnstatement or shall be zero if no expression is provided or if\n       there is noreturnstatement.\n\n       The result ofsqrt(expression) shall be the square root of the\n       expression. The result shall be truncated in the least\n       significant decimal place. The scale of the result shall be the\n       scale of the expression or the value ofscale, whichever is\n       larger.\n\n       The result oflength(expression) shall be the total number of\n       significant decimal digits in the expression. The scale of the\n       result shall be zero.\n\n       The result ofscale(expression) shall be the scale of the\n       expression. The scale of the result shall be zero.\n\n       A numeric constant shall be an expression. The scale shall be the\n       number of digits that follow the radix point in the input\n       representing the constant, or zero if no radix point appears.\n\n       The sequence (expression) shall be an expression with the same\n       value and scale asexpression.  The parentheses can be used to\n       alter the normal precedence.\n\n       The semantics of the unary and binary operators are as follows:\n\n       -expressionThe result shall be the negative of theexpression.  The\n             scale of the result shall be the scale ofexpression.\n\n       The unary increment and decrement operators shall not modify the\n       scale of the named expression upon which they operate.

Only identifiers that are local to a function need be\n       declared with theautocommand. The arguments to a function shall\n       be local to the function.  All other identifiers are assumed to\n       be global and available to all functions. All identifiers, global\n       and local, have initial values of zero. Identifiers declared as\n       auto shall be allocated on entry to the function and released on\n       returning from the function. They therefore do not retain values\n       between function calls. Auto arrays shall be specified by the\n       array name followed by empty square brackets. On entry to a\n       function, the old values of the names that appear as parameters\n       and as automatic variables shall be pushed onto a stack. Until\n       the function returns, reference to these names shall refer only\n       to the new values.\n\n       References to any of these names from other functions that are\n       called from this function also refer to the new value until one\n       of those functions uses the same name for a local variable.\n\n       When a statement is an expression, unless the main operator is an\n       assignment, execution of the statement shall write the value of\n       the expression followed by a <newline>.\n\n       When a statement is a string, execution of the statement shall\n       write the value of the string.\n\n       Statements separated by <semicolon> or <newline> characters shall\n       be executed sequentially. In an interactive invocation ofbc,\n       each time a <newline> is read that satisfies the grammatical\n       production:\n\n           input_item : semicolon_list NEWLINE\n\n       the sequential list of statements making up thesemicolon_listshall be executed immediately and any output produced by that\n       execution shall be written without any delay due to buffering.\n\n       In anifstatement (if(relation)statement), thestatementshall\n       be executed if the relation is true.\n\n       Thewhilestatement (while(relation)statement) implements a loop\n       in which therelationis tested; each time therelationis true,\n       thestatementshall be executed and therelationretested. When\n       therelationis false, execution shall resume afterstatement.\n\n       Aforstatement(for(expression;relation;expression)statement)\n       shall be the same as:first-expressionwhile (relation) {statementlast-expression}\n\n       The application shall ensure that all three expressions are\n       present.\n\n       Thebreakstatement shall cause termination of afororwhilestatement.\n\n       Theautostatement (autoidentifier[,identifier]...) shall\n       cause the values of the identifiers to be pushed down.  The\n       identifiers can be ordinary identifiers or array identifiers.\n       Array identifiers shall be specified by following the array name\n       by empty square brackets. The application shall ensure that theautostatement is the first statement in a function definition.\n\n       Adefinestatement:\n\n           defineLETTER(opt_parameter_list) {opt_auto_define_liststatement_list}\n\n       defines a function namedLETTER.  If a function namedLETTERwas\n       previously defined, thedefinestatement shall replace the\n       previous definition. The expression:\n\n           LETTER (opt_argument_list)\n\n       shall invoke the function namedLETTER.  The behavior is\n       undefined if the number of arguments in the invocation does not\n       match the number of parameters in the definition. Functions shall\n       be defined before they are invoked. A function shall be\n       considered to be defined within its own body, so recursive calls\n       are valid. The values of numeric constants within a function\n       shall be interpreted in the base specified by the value of theibaseregister when the function is invoked.\n\n       Thereturnstatements (returnandreturn(expression)) shall cause\n       termination of a function, popping of its auto variables, and\n       specification of the result of the function. The first form shall\n       be equivalent toreturn(0).  The value and scale of the result\n       returned by the function shall be the value and scale of the\n       expression returned.\n\n       Thequitstatement (quit) shall stop execution of abcprogram at\n       the point where the statement occurs in the input, even if it\n       occurs in a function definition, or in anif,for, orwhilestatement.\n\n       The following functions shall be defined when the-loption is\n       specified:s(expression)\n             Sine of argument in radians.c(expression)\n             Cosine of argument in radians.a(expression)\n             Arctangent of argument.l(expression)\n             Natural logarithm of argument.e(expression)\n             Exponential function of argument.j(expression1,expression2)\n             Bessel function ofexpression2of the first kind of integer\n             orderexpression1.\n\n       The scale of the result returned by these functions shall be the\n       value of thescaleregister at the time the function is invoked.\n       The value of thescaleregister after these functions have\n       completed their execution shall be the same value it had upon\n       invocation.

Current implementations that implementbcusingdcare expected to be compliant.\n\n       The exit status for error conditions has been left unspecified\n       for several reasons:\n\n        *  Thebcutility is used in both interactive and non-\n           interactive situations.  Different exit codes may be\n           appropriate for the two uses.\n\n        *  It is unclear when a non-zero exit should be given; divide-\n           by-zero, undefined functions, and syntax errors are all\n           possibilities.\n\n        *  It is not clear what utility the exit status has.\n\n        *  In the 4.3 BSD, System V, and Ninth Edition implementations,bcworks in conjunction withdc.  Thedcutility is the\n           parent,bcis the child. This was done to cleanly terminatebcifdcaborted.\n\n       The decision to havebcexit upon encountering an inaccessible\n       input file is based on the belief thatbc file1 file2is used\n       most often when at leastfile1contains data/function\n       declarations/initializations. Havingbccontinue with\n       prerequisite files missing is probably not useful. There is no\n       implication in the CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS section thatbcmust\n       check all its files for accessibility before opening any of them.\n\n       There was considerable debate on the appropriateness of the\n       language accepted bybc.  Several reviewers preferred to see\n       either a pure subset of the C language or some changes to make\n       the language more compatible with C.  While thebclanguage has\n       some obvious similarities to C, it has never claimed to be\n       compatible with any version of C. An interpreter for a subset of\n       C might be a very worthwhile utility, and it could potentially\n       makebcobsolete. However, no such utility is known in historical\n       practice, and it was not within the scope of this volume of\n       POSIX.1\u20102017 to define such a language and utility. If and when\n       they are defined, it may be appropriate to include them in a\n       future version of this standard. This left the following\n       alternatives:\n\n        1. Exclude any calculator language from this volume of\n           POSIX.1\u20102017.\n\n           The consensus of the standard developers was that a simple\n           programmatic calculator language is very useful for both\n           applications and interactive users. The only arguments for\n           excluding any calculator were that it would become obsolete\n           if and when a C-compatible one emerged, or that the absence\n           would encourage the development of such a C-compatible one.\n           These arguments did not sufficiently address the needs of\n           current application developers.\n\n        2. Standardize the historicaldc, possibly with minor\n           modifications.\n\n           The consensus of the standard developers was thatdcis a\n           fundamentally less usable language and that that would be far\n           too severe a penalty for avoiding the issue of being similar\n           to but incompatible with C.\n\n        3. Standardize the historicalbc, possibly with minor\n           modifications.\n\n           This was the approach taken. Most of the proponents of\n           changing the language would not have been satisfied until\n           most or all of the incompatibilities with C were resolved.\n           Since most of the changes considered most desirable would\n           break historical applications and require significant\n           modification to historical implementations, almost no\n           modifications were made. The one significant modification\n           that was made was the replacement of the historicalbcassignment operators\"=+\", and so on, with the more modern\"+=\", and so on. The older versions are considered to be\n           fundamentally flawed because of the lexical ambiguity in uses\n           likea=-1.\n\n           In order to permit implementations to deal with backwards-\n           compatibility as they see fit, the behavior of this one\n           ambiguous construct was made undefined. (At least three\n           implementations have been known to support this change\n           already, so the degree of change involved should not be\n           great.)\n\n       The'%'operator is the mathematical remainder operator whenscaleis zero. The behavior of this operator for other values ofscaleis from historical implementations ofbc, and has been\n       maintained for the sake of historical applications despite its\n       non-intuitive nature.\n\n       Historical implementations permit settingibaseandobaseto a\n       broader range of values. This includes values less than 2, which\n       were not seen as sufficiently useful to standardize. These\n       implementations do not interpret input properly for values ofibasethat are greater than 16. This is because numeric constants\n       are recognized syntactically, rather than lexically, as described\n       in this volume of POSIX.1\u20102017. They are built from lexical\n       tokens of single hexadecimal digits and <period> characters.\n       Since <blank> characters between tokens are not visible at the\n       syntactic level, it is not possible to recognize the multi-digit\n       ``digits'' used in the higher bases properly. The ability to\n       recognize input in these bases was not considered useful enough\n       to require modifying these implementations.  Note that the\n       recognition of numeric constants at the syntactic level is not a\n       problem with conformance to this volume of POSIX.1\u20102017, as it\n       does not impact the behavior of conforming applications (and\n       correctbcprograms). Historical implementations also accept\n       input with all of the digits'0'-'9'and'A'-'F'regardless of\n       the value ofibase; since digits with value greater than or equal\n       toibaseare not really appropriate, the behavior when they\n       appear is undefined, except for the common case of:\n\n           ibase=8;\n               /* Process in octal base. */\n           ...\n           ibase=A\n               /* Restore decimal base. */\n\n       In some historical implementations, if the expression to be\n       written is an uninitialized array element, a leading <space>\n       and/or up to four leading 0 characters may be output before the\n       character zero. This behavior is considered a bug; it is unlikely\n       that any currently conforming application relies on:\n\n           echo 'b[3]' | bc\n\n       returning 00000 rather than 0.\n\n       Exact calculation of the number of fractional digits to output\n       for a given value in a base other than 10 can be computationally\n       expensive.  Historical implementations use a faster\n       approximation, and this is permitted. Note that the requirements\n       apply only to values ofobasethat this volume of POSIX.1\u20102017\n       requires implementations to support (in particular, not to 1, 0,\n       or negative bases, if an implementation supports them as an\n       extension).\n\n       Historical implementations ofbcdid not allow array parameters\n       to be passed as the last parameter to a function. New\n       implementations are encouraged to remove this restriction even\n       though it is not required by the grammar.",

If\n           specified, all operations are applied to file system in the\n           indicated disk image. This option is similar to--root=, but\n           operates on file systems stored in disk images or block\n           devices. The disk image should either contain just a file\n           system or a set of file systems within a GPT partition table,\n           following theDiscoverable Partitions Specification[4]. For\n           further information on supported disk images, seesystemd-nspawn(1)'s switch of the same name.\n\n           Added in version 252.--image-policy=policyTakes an image policy string as argument, as persystemd.image-policy(7). The policy is enforced when\n           operating on the disk image specified via--image=, see\n           above.

With \"image\" or \"host\" no fallback\n           search will be performed if the binaries are not found in the\n           selected source.\n\n           Added in version 252.-p,--print-esp-pathThis option modifies the behaviour ofstatus. Only prints the\n           path to the EFI System Partition (ESP) to standard output and\n           exits.\n\n           Added in version 236.-x,--print-boot-pathThis option modifies the behaviour ofstatus. Only prints the\n           path to the Extended Boot Loader partition if it exists, and\n           the path to the ESP otherwise to standard output and exit.\n           This command is useful to determine where to place boot\n           loader entries, as they are preferably placed in the Extended\n           Boot Loader partition if it exists and in the ESP otherwise.\n\n           Boot Loader Specification Type #1 entries should generally be\n           placed in the directory \"$(bootctl -x)/loader/entries/\".\n           Existence of that directory may also be used as indication\n           that boot loader entry support is available on the system.\n           Similarly, Boot Loader Specification Type #2 entries should\n           be placed in the directory \"$(bootctl -x)/EFI/Linux/\".\n\n           Note that this option (similarly to the--print-esp-pathoption mentioned above), is available independently from the\n           boot loader used, i.e. also withoutsystemd-bootbeing\n           installed.\n\n           Added in version 242.-R,--print-root-devicePrint the path to the block device node backing the root file\n           system of the local OS. This prints a path such as\n           /dev/nvme0n1p5. If the root file system is backed by\n           dm-crypt/LUKS or dm-verity the underlying block device is\n           returned.

If the root file system is a network file system\n           (e.g. NFS, CIFS) the operation will fail.\n\n           Added in version 254.--no-variablesDo not touch the firmware's boot loader list stored in EFI\n           variables.\n\n           Added in version 220.--gracefulIgnore failure when the EFI System Partition cannot be found,\n           when EFI variables cannot be written, or a different or newer\n           boot loader is already installed.

Accepted duringinstall, and takes one\n           of \"auto\", \"machine-id\", \"os-id\", \"os-image-id\" or an\n           arbitrary string prefixed by \"literal:\" as argument.\n\n           If set tomachine-idthe entries are named after the machine\n           ID of the running system (e.g.\n           \"b0e793a9baf14b5fa13ecbe84ff637ac\"). Seemachine-id(5)for\n           details about the machine ID concept and file.\n\n           If set toos-idthe entries are named after the OS ID of the\n           running system, i.e. theID=field ofos-release(5)(e.g.\n           \"fedora\"). Similarly, if set toos-image-idthe entries are\n           named after the OS image ID of the running system, i.e. theIMAGE_ID=field of os-release (e.g.\n           \"vendorx-cashier-system\").\n\n           If set toauto(the default), the /etc/kernel/entry-token\n           file will be read if it exists, and the stored value used.\n           Otherwise if the local machine ID is initialized it is used.\n           OtherwiseIMAGE_ID=from os-release will be used, if set.\n           Otherwise,ID=from os-release will be used, if set.\n\n           Unless set to \"machine-id\", or when--make-entry-directory=yesis used the selected token string\n           is written to a file /etc/kernel/entry-token, to ensure it\n           will be used for future entries. This file is also read bykernel-install(8), in order to identify under which name to\n           generate boot loader entries for newly installed kernels, or\n           to determine the entry names for removing old ones.\n\n           Using the machine ID for naming the entries is generally\n           preferable, however there are cases where using the other\n           identifiers is a good option. Specifically: if the\n           identification data that the machine ID entails shall not be\n           stored on the (unencrypted)$BOOTpartition, or if the ID\n           shall be generated on first boot and is not known when the\n           entries are prepared. Note that using the machine ID has the\n           benefit that multiple parallel installations of the same OS\n           can coexist on the same medium, and they can update their\n           boot loader entries independently. When using another\n           identifier (such as the OS ID or the OS image ID), parallel\n           installations of the same OS would try to use the same entry\n           name. To support parallel installations, the installer must\n           use a different entry token when adding a second\n           installation.\n\n           Added in version 251.--all-architecturesInstall binaries for all supported EFI architectures (this\n           implies--no-variables).\n\n           Added in version 252.--efi-boot-option-description=Description of the entry added to the firmware's boot option\n           list. Defaults to \"Linux Boot Manager\".\n\n           Using the default entry name \"Linux Boot Manager\" is\n           generally preferable as only one bootloader installed to a\n           single ESP partition should be used to boot any number of OS\n           installations found on the various disks installed in the\n           system. Specifically distributions should not use this flag\n           to install a branded entry in the boot option list. However\n           in situations with multiple disks, each with their own ESP\n           partition, it can be beneficial to make it easier to identify\n           the bootloader being used in the firmware's boot option menu.\n\n           Added in version 252.--dry-runDry run forunlinkandcleanup.\n\n           In dry run mode, the unlink and cleanup operations only print\n           the files that would get deleted without actually deleting\n           them.\n\n           Added in version 253.--no-pagerDo not pipe output into a pager.--json=MODEShows output formatted as JSON.

The display will display each IO generated,\n       with the time (seconds) along the X-axis, the block number\n       (start) along the Y-axis and the number of blocks transferred in\n       the IO represented along the Z-axis.",

        "description": "The C++ and Java languages provide function overloading, which\n       means that you can write many functions with the same name,\n       providing that each function takes parameters of different types.\n       In order to be able to distinguish these similarly named\n       functions C++ and Java encode them into a low-level assembler\n       name which uniquely identifies each different version.  This\n       process is known asmangling. Thec++filt[1] program does the\n       inverse mapping: it decodes (demangles) low-level names into\n       user-level names so that they can be read.\n\n       Every alphanumeric word (consisting of letters, digits,\n       underscores, dollars, or periods) seen in the input is a\n       potential mangled name.  If the name decodes into a C++ name, the\n       C++ name replaces the low-level name in the output, otherwise the\n       original word is output.  In this way you can pass an entire\n       assembler source file, containing mangled names, throughc++filtand see the same source file containing demangled names.\n\n       You can also usec++filtto decipher individual symbols by\n       passing them on the command line:\n\n               c++filt <symbol>\n\n       If nosymbolarguments are given,c++filtreads symbol names from\n       the standard input instead.  All the results are printed on the\n       standard output.  The difference between reading names from the\n       command line versus reading names from the standard input is that\n       command-line arguments are expected to be just mangled names and\n       no checking is performed to separate them from surrounding text.\n       Thus for example:\n\n               c++filt -n _Z1fv\n\n       will work and demangle the name to \"f()\" whereas:\n\n               c++filt -n _Z1fv,\n\n       will not work.  (Note the extra comma at the end of the mangled\n       name which makes it invalid).  This command however will work:\n\n               echo _Z1fv, | c++filt -n\n\n       and will display \"f(),\", i.e., the demangled name followed by a\n       trailing comma.  This behaviour is because when the names are\n       read from the standard input it is expected that they might be\n       part of an assembler source file where there might be extra,\n       extraneous characters trailing after a mangled name.  For\n       example:\n\n                   .type   _Z1fv, @function",
        "options": "-_--strip-underscoreOn some systems, both the C and C++ compilers put an\n           underscore in front of every name.  For example, the C name\n           \"foo\" gets the low-level name \"_foo\".  This option removes\n           the initial underscore.  Whetherc++filtremoves the\n           underscore by default is target dependent.-n--no-strip-underscoreDo not remove the initial underscore.-p--no-paramsWhen demangling the name of a function, do not display the\n           types of the function's parameters.-t--typesAttempt to demangle types as well as function names.  This is\n           disabled by default since mangled types are normally only\n           used internally in the compiler, and they can be confused\n           with non-mangled names.  For example, a function called \"a\"\n           treated as a mangled type name would be demangled to \"signed\n           char\".-i--no-verboseDo not include implementation details (if any) in the\n           demangled output.-r-R--recurse-limit--no-recurse-limit--recursion-limit--no-recursion-limitEnables or disables a limit on the amount of recursion\n           performed whilst demangling strings.  Since the name mangling\n           formats allow for an infinite level of recursion it is\n           possible to create strings whose decoding will exhaust the\n           amount of stack space available on the host machine,\n           triggering a memory fault.

When an application needs to use a specific\n       programming environment rather than the implementation default\n       programming environment while compiling, the application shall\n       first verify that the implementation supports the desired\n       environment.

Assume that both libraries reside in/a/b/c.  The\n           command line to compile and link in the desired way is:\n\n               c99 -L /a/b/c main.o a.c -l Q b.c -l p\n\n           In this case the-Loption need only precede the first-loption, since bothlibQ.aandlibp.areside in the same\n           directory.\n\n           Multiple-Loptions can be used when library name collisions\n           occur.

        "rationale": "Thec99utility is based on thec89utility originally introduced\n       in the ISO POSIX\u20102:1993 standard.\n\n       Some of the changes fromc89include the ability to intersperse\n       options and operands (which manyc89implementations allowed\n       despite it not being specified), the description of-las an\n       option instead of an operand, and the modification to the\n       contents of the Standard Libraries section to account for new\n       headers and options; for example,<spawn.h>added to the\n       description of-l rt, and-l traceadded for the Tracing option.\n\n       POSIX.1\u20102008 specifies that thec99utility must be able to use\n       regular files for*.ofiles and fora.outfiles. Implementations\n       are free to overwrite existing files of other types when\n       attempting to create object files and executable files, but are\n       not required to do so. If something other than a regular file is\n       specified and using it fails for any reason,c99is required to\n       issue a diagnostic message and exit with a non-zero exit status.\n       But for some file types, the problem may not be noticed for a\n       long time. For example, if a FIFO nameda.outexists in the\n       current directory,c99may attempt to opena.outand will hang in\n       theopen() call until another process opens the FIFO for reading.\n       Thenc99may write most of thea.outto the FIFO and fail when it\n       tries to seek back close to the start of the file to insert a\n       timestamp (FIFOs are not seekable files). Thec99utility is also\n       allowed to issue a diagnostic immediately if it encounters ana.outor*.ofile that is not a regular file. For portable use,\n       applications should ensure that anya.out,-ooption-argument, or*.ofiles corresponding to any*.cfiles do not conflict with\n       names already in use that are not regular files or symbolic links\n       that point to regular files.\n\n       On many systems, multi-threaded applications run in a programming\n       environment that is distinct from that used by single-threaded\n       applications. This multi-threaded programming environment (in\n       addition to needing to specify-l pthreadat link time) may\n       require additional flags to be set when headers are processed at\n       compile time (-D_REENTRANTbeing common). This programming\n       environment is orthogonal to the type size programming\n       environments discussed above and listed inTable 4-4, ProgrammingEnvironments: Type Sizes.  This version of the standard addsgetconfutility calls to provide the C compiler flags and\n       linker/loader flags needed to support multi-threaded\n       applications. Note that on a system where single-threaded\n       applications are a special case of a multi-threaded application,\n       both of thesegetconfcalls may return NULL strings; on other\n       implementations both of these strings may be non-NULL strings.\n\n       The C standardization committee invented trigraphs (e.g.,\"??!\"to represent'|') to address character portability problems in\n       development environments based on national variants of the 7-bit\n       ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard character set. However, these\n       environments were already obsolete by the time the first ISO C\n       standard was published, and in practice trigraphs have not been\n       used for their intended purpose, and usually are intended to have\n       their original meaning in K&R C.  For example, in practice a C-\n       language source string like\"What??!\"is usually intended to end\n       in two <question-mark> characters and an <exclamation-mark>, not\n       in'|'.\n\n       When the-Eoption is used, execution of some#pragmapreprocessor directives may simply result in a copy of the\n       directive being included in the output as part of the allowed\n       extra information used by subsequent compilation passes (see\n       STDOUT).",

By defaultcaluses the adoption\n       date of 3 Sept 1752. From that date forward the Gregorian\n       calendar is displayed; previous dates use the Julian calendar\n       system. 11 days were removed at the time of adoption to bring the\n       calendar in sync with solar events. So Sept 1752 has a mix of\n       Julian and Gregorian dates by which the 2nd is followed by the\n       14th (the 3rd through the 13th are absent).\n\n       Optionally, either the proleptic Gregorian calendar or the Julian\n       calendar may be used exclusively.

This\n           option does not switch from the Gregorian to the Julian\n           calendar system, that is controlled by the--reformoption.\n\n           Sometimes Gregorian calendars using ordinal dates are\n           referred to as Julian calendars. This can be confusing due to\n           the many date related conventions that use Julian in their\n           name: (ordinal) julian date, julian (calendar) date,\n           (astronomical) julian date, (modified) julian date, and more.\n           This option is named julian, because ordinal days are\n           identified as julian by the POSIX standard. However, be aware\n           thatcalalso uses the Julian calendar system. SeeDESCRIPTIONabove.--reformvalThis option sets the adoption date of the Gregorian calendar\n           reform. Calendar dates previous to reform use the Julian\n           calendar system. Calendar dates after reform use the\n           Gregorian calendar system.

This argument may require explicit\n              preparation of the effective set.--cap-uid=<uid>\n              use thecap_setuid(3)function to set the UID of the\n              current process. This performs all preparations for\n              setting the UID without dropping capabilities in the\n              process. Following this command the prevailing effective\n              capabilities will be lowered.--is-uid=<id>Exit with status 1 unless the current UID equals<id>.--gid=<id>Force all GID values to equalidusing thesetgid(2)system call.--is-gid=<id>Exit with status 1 unless the current GIQ equals<id>.--groups=<gid-list>Set the supplementary groups to the numerical list\n              provided. The groups are set with thesetgroups(2)system\n              call. See--userfor a more convenient way of doing this.--keep=<0|1>In a non-pure capability mode, the kernel provides liberal\n              privilege to the super-user. However, it is normally the\n              case that when the super-user changes UID to some lesser\n              user, then capabilities are dropped. For these situations,\n              the kernel can permit the process to retain its\n              capabilities after asetuid(2)system call. This feature\n              is known askeep-capssupport. The way to activate it\n              using this program is with this argument. Setting the\n              value to 1 will causekeep-capsto be active. Setting it\n              to 0 will cause keep-caps to deactivate for the current\n              process. In all cases,keep-capsis deactivated when anexec() is performed. See--secbitsand--modefor ways to\n              disable this feature.--secbits=NSet the security-bits for the program.  This is done using\n              theprctl(2)PR_SET_SECUREBITSoperation.  The list of\n              supported bits and their meaning can be found in the<sys/secbits.h>header file. The program will list these\n              bits via the--printcommand.  The argument is expressed\n              as a numeric bitmask, in any of the formats permitted bystrtoul(3).  An alternative to this bit-twiddling is\n              embedded in the--mode*commandline arguments.--chroot=/some/pathExecute thechroot(2)system call with the new root-\n              directory (/) equal topath.  This operation requiresCAP_SYS_CHROOTto be in effect.--forkfor=secThis command causes the program to fork a child process\n              for so many seconds. The child will sleep that long and\n              then exit with status 0. The purpose of this command is to\n              support exploring the way processes are killable in the\n              face of capability changes. See the--killitcommand. Only\n              one fork can be active at a time.--killit=sigThis commands causes a--forkforchild to bekill(2)d with\n              the specified signal. The command then waits for the child\n              to exit.  If the exit status does not match the signal\n              being used to kill it, thecapshprogram exits with status\n              1.--explain=cap_xxxGive a brief textual description of what privileges the\n              specified capability makes available to a running program.\n              Note, instead ofcap_xxx, one can provide a decimal number\n              andcapshwill look up the corresponding capability's\n              description.--shell=/full/pathThis option changes the shell that is invoked when the\n              argument==is encountered.--strictThis option toggles the suppression of subsequent attempts\n              to fixup--caps=and--inh=arguments. That is, when the\n              prevailing Effective flag does not containCAP_SETPCAP theto be raised Inheritable Flag values (in strict mode) arelimited to those in the Permitted set. The strict modedefaults to off. Supplying this argument an even number oftimes restores this default behavior.--suggest=phraseScan each of the textual descriptions of capabilities,\n              known tocapsh, and display all descriptions that includephrase.--decode=NThis is a convenience feature. If you look at/proc/1/statusthere are some capability related fields of\n              the following form:\n\n              CapInh:   0000000000000000\n              CapPrm:   0000003fffffffff\n              CapEff:   0000003fffffffff\n              CapBnd:   0000003fffffffff\n              CapAmb:   0000000000000000\n\n              This option provides a quick way to decode a capability\n              vector represented in this hexadecimal form.  Here's an\n              example that decodes the two lowest capability bits:\n\n              $capsh --decode=30x0000000000000003=cap_chown,cap_dac_override--supports=xxxAs the kernel evolves, more capabilities are added. This\n              option can be used to verify the existence of a capability\n              on the system. For example,--supports=cap_syslogwill\n              causecapshto promptly exit with a status of 1 when run\n              on kernel 2.6.27.  However, when run on kernel 2.6.38 it\n              will silently succeed.--has-p=xxxExit with status 1 unless thepermittedvector has\n              capabilityxxxraised.--has-ambientPerforms a check to see if the running kernel supports\n              ambient capabilities. If not,capshexits with status 1.--has-a=xxxExit with status 1 unless theambientvector has\n              capabilityxxxraised.--has-b=xxxExit with status 1 unless theboundingvector has\n              capabilityxxxin its (default) non-blocked state.--iab=xxxAttempts to set the IAB tuple of inheritable capability\n              vectors.  The text conventions used forxxxare those ofcap_iab_from_text(3).--addamb=xxxAdds the specified ambient capability to the running\n              process.--delamb=xxxRemoves the specified ambient capability from the running\n              process.--noambDrops all ambient capabilities from the running process.--noenvSuppresses overriding of the HOME and USER environment\n              variables when a subsequent--userargument is processed.--quietThis argument is ignored unless it is the first one. If\n              present, it suppresses the capsh runtime check to confirm\n              the running libcap is recent enough that it can name all\n              of the kernel supported capability values.",

If nodirectoryoperand is given and theHOMEenvironment\n           variable is set to a non-empty value, thecdutility shall\n           behave as if the directory named in theHOMEenvironment\n           variable was specified as thedirectoryoperand.\n\n        3.

If the pathname is null, test if the\n           concatenation of dot, a <slash> character, and the operand\n           names a directory.

If, as a result of\n               this canonicalization, thecurpathvariable is null, no\n               further steps shall be taken.\n\n        9. Ifcurpathis longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes (including the\n           terminating null) and thedirectoryoperand was not longer\n           than {PATH_MAX} bytes (including the terminating null), thencurpathshall be converted from an absolute pathname to an\n           equivalent relative pathname if possible. This conversion\n           shall always be considered possible if the value ofPWD, with\n           a trailing <slash> added if it does not already have one, is\n           an initial substring ofcurpath.  Whether or not it is\n           considered possible under other circumstances is unspecified.\n           Implementations may also apply this conversion ifcurpathis\n           not longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes or thedirectoryoperand was\n           longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes.\n\n       10.

That option does not require the decryption of the\n       structure.--to-rsaConvert an RSA-PSS key to raw RSA format.\n\n       It requires an RSA-PSS key as input and will output a raw RSA\n       key. This command is necessary for compatibility with\n       applications that cannot read RSA-PSS keys.-p,--generate-privkeyGenerate a private key.\n\n       When generating RSA-PSS or RSA-OAEP private keys, the --hash\n       option will restrict the allowed hash for the key; For RSA-PSS\n       keys the --salt-size option is also acceptable.--key-type=strSpecify the key type to use on key generation.\n\n       This option can be combined with --generate-privkey, to specify\n       the key type to be generated. Valid options are, 'rsa',\n       'rsa-pss', 'rsa-oaep', 'dsa', 'ecdsa', 'ed25519, 'ed448',\n       'x25519', and 'x448'.'.  When combined with certificate\n       generation it can be used to specify an RSA-PSS certificate when\n       an RSA key is given.--bits=numSpecify the number of bits for key generation.  This\n       option takes an integer number as its argument.--curve=strSpecify the curve used for EC key generation.\n\n       Supported values are secp192r1, secp224r1, secp256r1, secp384r1\n       and secp521r1.--sec-param=security parameterSpecify the security level [low,\n       legacy, medium, high, ultra].\n\n       This is alternative to the bits option.--to-p8Convert a given key to a PKCS #8 structure.\n\n       This needs to be combined with --load-privkey.-8,--pkcs8Use PKCS #8 format for private keys.--provableGenerate a private key or parameters from a seed using\n       a provable method.\n\n       This will use the FIPS PUB186-4 algorithms (i.e., Shawe-Taylor)\n       for provable key generation.  When specified the private keys or\n       parameters will be generated from a seed, and can be later\n       validated with --verify-provable-privkey to be correctly\n       generated from the seed. You may specify --seed or allow GnuTLS\n       to generate one (recommended). This option can be combined with\n       --generate-privkey or --generate-dh-params.\n\n       That option applies to RSA and DSA keys. On the DSA keys the PQG\n       parameters are generated using the seed, and on RSA the two\n       primes.--verify-provable-privkeyVerify a private key generated from a\n       seed using a provable method.\n\n       This will use the FIPS-186-4 algorithms for provable key\n       generation. You may specify --seed or use the seed stored in the\n       private key structure.--seed=strWhen generating a private key use the given hex-\n       encoded seed.\n\n       The seed acts as a security parameter for the private key, and\n       thus a seed size which corresponds to the security level of the\n       private key should be provided (e.g., 256-bits seed).CRL related options-l,--crl-infoPrint information on the given CRL structure.--generate-crlGenerate a CRL.\n\n       This option generates a Certificate Revocation List. When\n       combined with --load-crl it would use the loaded CRL as base for\n       the generated (i.e., all revoked certificates in the base will be\n       copied to the new CRL).  To add new certificates to the CRL use\n       --load-certificate.--verify-crlVerify a Certificate Revocation List using a trusted\n       list.  This option must appear in combination with the following\n       options: load-ca-certificate.\n\n       The trusted certificate list must be loaded with\n       --load-ca-certificate.Certificate verification related options-e,--verify-chainVerify a PEM encoded certificate chain.\n\n       Verifies the validity of a certificate chain. That is, an ordered\n       set of certificates where each one is the issuer of the previous,\n       and the first is the end-certificate to be validated. In a proper\n       chain the last certificate is a self signed one. It can be\n       combined with --verify-purpose or --verify-hostname.--verifyVerify a PEM encoded certificate (chain) against a\n       trusted set.\n\n       The trusted certificate list can be loaded with\n       --load-ca-certificate. If no certificate list is provided, then\n       the system's trusted certificate list is used. Note that during\n       verification multiple paths may be explored. On a successful\n       verification the successful path will be the last one. It can be\n       combined with --verify-purpose or --verify-hostname.--verify-hostname=strSpecify a hostname to be used for\n       certificate chain verification.\n\n       This is to be combined with one of the verify certificate\n       options.--verify-email=strSpecify a email to be used for certificate\n       chain verification.  This option must not appear in combination\n       with any of the following options: verify-hostname.\n\n       This is to be combined with one of the verify certificate\n       options.--verify-purpose=strSpecify a purpose OID to be used for\n       certificate chain verification.\n\n       This object identifier restricts the purpose of the certificates\n       to be verified. Example purposes are 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1 (TLS WWW),\n       1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4 (EMAIL) etc. Note that a CA certificate without\n       a purpose set (extended key usage) is valid for any purpose.--verify-allow-brokenAllow broken algorithms, such as MD5 for\n       verification.\n\n       This can be combined with --p7-verify, --verify or\n       --verify-chain.--verify-profile=strSpecify a security level profile to be used\n       for verification.\n\n       This option can be used to specify a certificate verification\n       profile. Certificate\n           verification profiles correspond to the security level. This\n       should be one of\n           'none', 'very weak', 'low', 'legacy', 'medium', 'high',\n       'ultra',\n           'future'. Note that by default no profile is applied, unless\n       one is set\n           as minimum in the gnutls configuration file.PKCS#7 structure options--p7-generateGenerate a PKCS #7 structure.\n\n       This option generates a PKCS #7 certificate container structure.\n       To add certificates in the structure use --load-certificate and\n       --load-crl.--p7-signSigns using a PKCS #7 structure.\n\n       This option generates a PKCS #7 structure containing a signature\n       for the provided data from infile. The data are stored within the\n       structure. The signer certificate has to be specified using\n       --load-certificate and --load-privkey. The input to\n       --load-certificate can be a list of certificates. In case of a\n       list, the first certificate is used for signing and the other\n       certificates are included in the structure.--p7-detached-signSigns using a detached PKCS #7 structure.\n\n       This option generates a PKCS #7 structure containing a signature\n       for the provided data from infile. The signer certificate has to\n       be specified using --load-certificate and --load-privkey. The\n       input to --load-certificate can be a list of certificates. In\n       case of a list, the first certificate is used for signing and the\n       other certificates are included in the structure.--p7-include-cert,--no-p7-include-certThe signer's certificate\n       will be included in the cert list.  Theno-p7-include-certform\n       will disable the option.  This option is enabled by default.\n\n       This options works with --p7-sign or --p7-detached-sign and will\n       include or exclude the signer's certificate into the generated\n       signature.--p7-time,--no-p7-timeWill include a timestamp in the PKCS #7\n       structure.  Theno-p7-timeform will disable the option.\n\n       This option will include a timestamp in the generated signature--p7-show-data,--no-p7-show-dataWill show the embedded data in\n       the PKCS #7 structure.  Theno-p7-show-dataform will disable the\n       option.\n\n       This option can be combined with --p7-verify or --p7-info and\n       will display the embedded signed data in the PKCS #7 structure.--p7-infoPrint information on a PKCS #7 structure.--p7-verifyVerify the provided PKCS #7 structure.\n\n       This option verifies the signed PKCS #7 structure. The\n       certificate list to use for verification can be specified with\n       --load-ca-certificate. When no certificate list is provided, then\n       the system's certificate list is used. Alternatively a direct\n       signer can be provided using --load-certificate. A key purpose\n       can be enforced with the --verify-purpose option, and the\n       --load-data option will utilize detached data.--smime-to-p7Convert S/MIME to PKCS #7 structure.Other options--generate-dh-paramsGenerate PKCS #3 encoded Diffie-Hellman\n       parameters.\n\n       The will generate random parameters to be used with\n       Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The output parameters will be in\n       PKCS #3 format. Note that it is recommended to use the\n       --get-dh-params option instead.NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED--get-dh-paramsList the included PKCS #3 encoded Diffie-Hellman\n       parameters.\n\n       Returns stored DH parameters in GnuTLS. Those parameters returned\n       are defined in RFC7919, and can be considered standard parameters\n       for a TLS key exchange. This option is provided for old\n       applications which require DH parameters to be specified; modern\n       GnuTLS applications should not require them.--dh-infoPrint information PKCS #3 encoded Diffie-Hellman\n       parameters.--load-privkey=strLoads a private key file.\n\n       This can be either a file or a PKCS #11 URL--load-pubkey=strLoads a public key file.\n\n       This can be either a file or a PKCS #11 URL--load-request=strLoads a certificate request file.\n\n       This option can be used with a file--load-certificate=strLoads a certificate file.\n\n       This option can be used with a file--load-ca-privkey=strLoads the certificate authority's private\n       key file.\n\n       This can be either a file or a PKCS #11 URL--load-ca-certificate=strLoads the certificate authority's\n       certificate file.\n\n       This can be either a file or a PKCS #11 URL--load-crl=strLoads the provided CRL.\n\n       This option can be used with a file--load-data=strLoads auxiliary data.\n\n       This option can be used with a file--password=strPassword to use.\n\n       You can use this option to specify the password in the command\n       line instead of reading it from the tty. Note, that the command\n       line arguments are available for view in others in the system.\n       Specifying password as '' is the same as specifying no password.--null-passwordEnforce a NULL password.\n\n       This option enforces a NULL password. This is different than the\n       empty or no password in schemas like PKCS #8.--empty-passwordEnforce an empty password.\n\n       This option enforces an empty password. This is different than\n       the NULL or no password in schemas like PKCS #8.--hex-numbersPrint big number in an easier format to parse.--cprintIn certain operations it prints the information in C-\n       friendly format.\n\n       In certain operations it prints the information in C-friendly\n       format, suitable for including into C programs.--rsaGenerate RSA key.\n\n       When combined with --generate-privkey generates an RSA private\n       key.NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED--dsaGenerate DSA key.\n\n       When combined with --generate-privkey generates a DSA private\n       key.NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED--eccGenerate ECC (ECDSA) key.\n\n       When combined with --generate-privkey generates an elliptic curve\n       private key to be used with ECDSA.NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED--ecdsaThis is an alias for the--eccoption.NOTE: THIS OPTION IS DEPRECATED--hash=strHash algorithm to use for signing.\n\n       Available hash functions are SHA1, RMD160, SHA256, SHA384,\n       SHA512, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512.--salt-size=numSpecify the RSA-PSS key default salt size.

In this way, there is less  duplication  of  effort\n       required for describing the interactions of permissions. However,\n       the  behavior  of  this  utility is not described in terms of thechmod()  function  from   the   System   Interfaces   volume   of\n       POSIX.1\u20102017  because  that  specification requires certain side-\n       effects upon alternate file access control mechanisms that  might\n       not be appropriate, depending on the implementation.\n\n       Implementations that support mandatory file and record locking as\n       specified  by  the 1984 /usr/group standard historically used the\n       combination of set-group-ID bit set and group execute  bit  clear\n       to  indicate  mandatory locking. This condition is usually set or\n       cleared with the symbolic modepermsymbollinstead of thepermsymbolssandxso that the mandatory locking mode is not changed\n       without explicit indication that that was what the user intended.\n       Therefore,  the  details  on  how the implementation treats these\n       conditions must be defined in the documentation. This  volume  of\n       POSIX.1\u20102017  does  not  require  mandatory locking (nor does the\n       System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1\u20102017), but does allow  it  as\n       an  extension.  However, this volume of POSIX.1\u20102017 does require\n       that thelsandchmodutilities work consistently in  this  area.\n       Ifls-lfileindicates that the set-group-ID bit is set,chmodg-sfilemust clear it (assuming appropriate privileges exist  to\n       change modes).\n\n       The  System  V  and BSD versions use different exit status codes.\n       Some implementations used the exit  status  as  a  count  of  the\n       number of errors that occurred; this practice is unworkable since\n       it  can  overflow  the  range  of  valid exit status values. This\n       problem is avoided here by specifying  only  0  and  >0  as  exit\n       values.\n\n       The  System  Interfaces  volume  of  POSIX.1\u20102017  indicates that\n       implementation-defined restrictions may  cause  the  S_ISUID  and\n       S_ISGID  bits  to  be ignored. This volume of POSIX.1\u20102017 allows\n       thechmodutility to choose to modify these bits  before  callingchmod()  (or some function providing equivalent capabilities) for\n       non-regular   files.   Among   other    things,    this    allows\n       implementations that use the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on\n       directories   to   enable   extended  features  to  handle  these\n       extensions in an intelligent manner.\n\n       TheX permsymbol was adopted from BSD-based systems  because  it\n       provides  commonly desired functionality when doing recursive (-Roption) modifications. Similar functionality is not  provided  by\n       thefindutility. Historical BSD versions ofchmod, however, only\n       supportedXwithop+;  it  has been extended in this volume of\n       POSIX.1\u20102017 because it is also useful withop=.   (It  has  also\n       been  added  forop-  even though it duplicatesx, in this case,\n       because it is intuitive and easier to explain.)\n\n       The grammar was extended with thepermcopynon-terminal to  allow\n       historical-practice forms of symbolic modes likeo=u -g(that is,\n       set  the  ``other''  permissions  to the permissions of ``owner''\n       minus the permissions of ``group'').",

Neither the System V nor BSDsumalgorithm\n       was selected. Since each of these was different and each was the\n       default behavior on those systems, no realistic compromise was\n       available if either were selected\u2014some set of historical\n       applications would break. Therefore, the name was changed tocksum.  Although the historicalsumcommands will probably\n       continue to be provided for many years, programs designed for\n       portability across systems should use the new name.\n\n       The algorithm selected is based on that used by the\n       ISO/IEC 8802\u20103:1996 standard (Ethernet) for the frame check\n       sequence field. The algorithm used does not match the technical\n       definition of achecksum; the term is used for historical\n       reasons. The length of the file is included in the CRC\n       calculation because this parallels inclusion of a length field by\n       Ethernet in its CRC, but also because it guards against\n       inadvertent collisions between files that begin with different\n       series of zero octets. The chance that two different files\n       produce identical CRCs is much greater when their lengths are not\n       considered. Keeping the length and the checksum of the file\n       itself separate would yield a slightly more robust algorithm, but\n       historical usage has always been that a single number (the\n       checksum as printed) represents the signature of the file. It was\n       decided that historical usage was the more important\n       consideration.\n\n       Early proposals contained modifications to the Ethernet algorithm\n       that involved extracting table values whenever an intermediate\n       result became zero. This was demonstrated to be less robust than\n       the current method and mathematically difficult to describe or\n       justify.\n\n       The calculation used is identical to that given in pseudo-code in\n       the referenced Sarwate article. The pseudo-code rendition is:\n\n           X <- 0; Y <- 0;\n           for i <- m -1 step -1 until 0 do\n               begin\n               T <- X(1) ^ A[i];\n               X(1) <- X(0); X(0) <- Y(1); Y(1) <- Y(0); Y(0) <- 0;\n               comment: f[T] and f'[T] denote the T-th words in the\n                   table f and f' ;\n               X <- X ^ f[T]; Y <- Y ^ f'[T];\n               end\n\n       The pseudo-code is reproduced exactly as given; however, note\n       that in the case ofcksum,A[i]represents a byte of the file,\n       the wordsXandYare treated as a single 32-bit value, and the\n       tablesfandf'are a single table containing 32-bit values.\n\n       The referenced Sarwate article also discusses generating the\n       table.",

Since this volume of POSIX.1\u20102017 does not specify\n       the block size used when doing input, comparisons of character\n       special files need not compare all of the data in those files.\n\n       For files which are not text files, line numbers simply reflect\n       the presence of a <newline>, without any implication that the\n       file is organized into lines.\n\n       Since the behavior of-sdiffers between implementations as to\n       whether error messages are written, the only way to ensure\n       consistent behavior ofcmpwhen-sis used is to redirect\n       standard error to/dev/null.\n\n       If error messages are wanted, instead of using-sstandard output\n       should be redirected to/dev/null, and anything written to\n       standard error should be discarded if the exit status is 1.

This is allowed by the inclusion\n       of the <additional info> fields in the output format. The\n       restriction on having a leading <blank> and no <newline>\n       characters is to make parsing for the filename easier. It is\n       recognized that some filenames containing white-space characters\n       make parsing difficult anyway, but the restriction does aid\n       programs used on systems where the names are predominantly well\n       behaved.",

For example:\n\n           command exec >unwritable-filedoes not cause a non-interactive script to abort, so that the\n       output status can be checked by the script.\n\n       Thecommand,env,nohup,time, andxargsutilities have been\n       specified to use exit code 127 if an error occurs so that\n       applications can distinguish ``failure to find a utility'' from\n       ``invoked utility exited with an error indication''. The value\n       127 was chosen because it is not commonly used for other\n       meanings; most utilities use small values for ``normal error\n       conditions'' and the values above 128 can be confused with\n       termination due to receipt of a signal. The value 126 was chosen\n       in a similar manner to indicate that the utility could be found,\n       but not invoked. Some scripts produce meaningful error messages\n       differentiating the 126 and 127 cases. The distinction between\n       exit codes 126 and 127 is based on KornShell practice that uses\n       127 when all attempts toexecthe utility fail with[ENOENT], and\n       uses 126 when any attempt toexecthe utility fails for any other\n       reason.\n\n       Since the-vand-Voptions ofcommandproduce output in relation\n       to the current shell execution environment,commandis generally\n       provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is called in a\n       subshell or separate utility execution environment, such as one\n       of the following:\n\n           (PATH=foo command -v)\n            nohup command -v\n\n       it does not necessarily produce correct results. For example,\n       when called withnohupor anexecfunction, in a separate utility\n       execution environment, most implementations are not able to\n       identify aliases, functions, or special built-ins.\n\n       Two types of regular built-ins could be encountered on a system\n       and these are described separately bycommand.  The description\n       of command search inSection 2.9.1.1,Command Search andExecutionallows for a standard utility to be implemented as a\n       regular built-in as long as it is found in the appropriate place\n       in aPATHsearch. So, for example,command-vtruemight yield/bin/trueor some similar pathname. Other implementation-defined\n       utilities that are not defined by this volume of POSIX.1\u20102017\n       might exist only as built-ins and have no pathname associated\n       with them. These produce output identified as (regular) built-\n       ins. Applications encountering these are not able to count onexecing them, using them withnohup, overriding them with a\n       differentPATH, and so on.",

        "rationale": "Sincecommandis a regular built-in utility it is always found\n       prior to thePATHsearch.\n\n       There is nothing in the description ofcommandthat implies the\n       command line is parsed any differently from that of any other\n       simple command. For example:\n\n           command a | b ; c\n\n       is not parsed in any special way that causes'|'or';'to be\n       treated other than a pipe operator or <semicolon> or that\n       prevents function lookup onborc.\n\n       Thecommandutility is somewhat similar to the Eighth Edition\n       shellbuiltincommand, but sincecommandalso goes to the file\n       system to search for utilities, the namebuiltinwould not be\n       intuitive.\n\n       Thecommandutility is most likely to be provided as a regular\n       built-in. It is not listed as a special built-in for the\n       following reasons:\n\n        *  The removal of exportable functions made the special\n           precedence of a special built-in unnecessary.\n\n        *  A special built-in has special properties (seeSection 2.14,Special Built-In Utilities) that were inappropriate for\n           invoking other utilities. For example, two commands such as:\n\n               date >unwritable-filecommand date >unwritable-filewould have entirely different results; in a non-interactive\n           script, the former would continue to execute the next\n           command, the latter would abort. Introducing this semantic\n           difference along with suppressing functions was seen to be\n           non-intuitive.\n\n       The-poption is present because it is useful to be able to\n       ensure a safe path search that finds all the standard utilities.\n       This search might not be identical to the one that occurs through\n       one of theexecfunctions (as defined in the System Interfaces\n       volume of POSIX.1\u20102017) whenPATHis unset. At the very least,\n       this feature is required to allow the script to access the\n       correct version ofgetconfso that the value of the default path\n       can be accurately retrieved.\n\n       Thecommand-vand-Voptions were added to satisfy requirements\n       from users that are currently accomplished by three different\n       historical utilities:typein the System V shell,whencein the\n       KornShell, andwhichin the C shell. Since there is no historical\n       agreement on how and what to accomplish here, the POSIXcommandutility was enhanced and the historical utilities were left\n       unmodified.  The C shellwhichmerely conducts a path search. The\n       KornShellwhenceis more elaborate\u2014in addition to the categories\n       required by POSIX, it also reports on tracked aliases, exported\n       aliases, and undefined functions.\n\n       The output format of-Vwas left mostly unspecified because human\n       users are its only audience.  Applications should not be written\n       to care about this information; they can use the output of-vto\n       differentiate between various types of commands, but the\n       additional information that may be emitted by the more verbose-Vis not needed and should not be arbitrarily constrained in its\n       verbosity or localization for application parsing reasons.",

        "rationale": "The-ioption exists on BSD systems, giving applications and\n       users a way to avoid accidentally removing files when copying.\n       Although the 4.3 BSD version does not prompt if the standard\n       input is not a terminal, the standard developers decided that use\n       of-iis a request for interaction, so when the destination path\n       exists, the utility takes instructions from whatever responds on\n       standard input.\n\n       The exact format of the interactive prompts is unspecified. Only\n       the general nature of the contents of prompts are specified\n       because implementations may desire more descriptive prompts than\n       those used on historical implementations. Therefore, an\n       application using the-ioption relies on the system to provide\n       the most suitable dialog directly with the user, based on the\n       behavior specified.\n\n       The-poption is historical practice on BSD systems, duplicating\n       the time of last data modification and time of last access. This\n       volume of POSIX.1\u20102017 extends it to preserve the user and group\n       IDs, as well as the file permissions. This requirement has\n       obvious problems in that the directories are almost certainly\n       modified after being copied. This volume of POSIX.1\u20102017 requires\n       that the modification times be preserved. The statement that the\n       order in which the characteristics are duplicated is unspecified\n       is to permit implementations to provide the maximum amount of\n       security for the user.  Implementations should take into account\n       the obvious security issues involved in setting the owner, group,\n       and mode in the wrong order or creating files with an owner,\n       group, or mode different from the final value.\n\n       It is unspecified whethercpwrites diagnostic messages when the\n       user and group IDs cannot be set due to the widespread practice\n       of users using-pto duplicate some portion of the file\n       characteristics, indifferent to the duplication of others.\n       Historic implementations only write diagnostic messages on errors\n       other than[EPERM].\n\n       Earlier versions of this standard included support for the-roption to copy file hierarchies. The-roption is historical\n       practice on BSD and BSD-derived systems. This option is no longer\n       specified by POSIX.1\u20102008 but may be present in some\n       implementations. The-Roption was added as a close synonym to\n       the-roption, selected for consistency with all other options in\n       this volume of POSIX.1\u20102017 that do recursive directory descent.\n\n       The difference between-Rand the removed-roption is in the\n       treatment bycpof file types other than regular and directory.\n       It was implementation-defined how the-option treated special\n       files to allow both historical implementations and those that\n       chose to support-rwith the same abilities as-Rdefined by this\n       volume of POSIX.1\u20102017. The original-rflag, for historic\n       reasons, did not handle special files any differently from\n       regular files, but always read the file and copied its contents.\n       This had obvious problems in the presence of special file types;\n       for example, character devices, FIFOs, and sockets.\n\n       When a failure occurs during the copying of a file hierarchy,cpis required to attempt to copy files that are on the same level\n       in the hierarchy or above the file where the failure occurred. It\n       is unspecified ifcpshall attempt to copy files below the file\n       where the failure occurred (which cannot succeed in any case).\n\n       Permissions, owners, and groups of created special file types\n       have been deliberately left as implementation-defined. This is to\n       allow systems to satisfy special requirements (for example,\n       allowing users to create character special devices, but requiring\n       them to be owned by a certain group). In general, it is strongly\n       suggested that the permissions, owner, and group be the same as\n       if the user had run the historicalmknod,ln, or other utility to\n       create the file. It is also probable that additional privileges\n       are required to create block, character, or other implementation-\n       defined special file types.\n\n       Additionally, the-poption explicitly requires that all set-\n       user-ID and set-group-ID permissions be discarded if any of the\n       owner or group IDs cannot be set. This is to keep users from\n       unintentionally giving away special privilege when copying\n       programs.\n\n       When creating regular files, historical versions ofcpuse the\n       mode of the source file as modified by the file mode creation\n       mask. Other choices would have been to use the mode of the source\n       file unmodified by the creation mask or to use the same mode as\n       would be given to a new file created by the user (plus the\n       execution bits of the source file) and then modify it by the file\n       mode creation mask. In the absence of any strong reason to change\n       historic practice, it was in large part retained.\n\n       When creating directories, historical versions ofcpuse the mode\n       of the source directory, plus read, write, and search bits for\n       the owner, as modified by the file mode creation mask. This is\n       done so thatcpcan copy trees where the user has read\n       permission, but the owner does not. A side-effect is that if the\n       file creation mask denies the owner permissions,cpfails. Also,\n       once the copy is done, historical versions ofcpset the\n       permissions on the created directory to be the same as the source\n       directory, unmodified by the file creation mask.\n\n       This behavior has been modified so thatcpis always able to\n       create the contents of the directory, regardless of the file\n       creation mask. After the copy is done, the permissions are set to\n       be the same as the source directory, as modified by the file\n       creation mask. This latter change from historical behavior is to\n       prevent users from accidentally creating directories with\n       permissions beyond those they would normally set and for\n       consistency with the behavior ofcpin creating files.\n\n       It is not a requirement thatcpdetect attempts to copy a file to\n       itself; however, implementations are strongly encouraged to do\n       so. Historical implementations have detected the attempt in most\n       cases.\n\n       There are two methods of copying subtrees in this volume of\n       POSIX.1\u20102017. The other method is described as part of thepaxutility (seepax(1p)).  Both methods are historical practice. Thecputility provides a simpler, more intuitive interface, whilepaxoffers a finer granularity of control. Each provides\n       additional functionality to the other; in particular,paxmaintains the hard-link structure of the hierarchy, whilecpdoes\n       not. It is the intention of the standard developers that the\n       results be similar (using appropriate option combinations in both\n       utilities). The results are not required to be identical; there\n       seemed insufficient gain to applications to balance the\n       difficulty of implementations having to guarantee that the\n       results would be exactly identical.\n\n       The wording allowingcpto copy a directory to implementation-\n       defined file types not specified by the System Interfaces volume\n       of POSIX.1\u20102017 is provided so that implementations supporting\n       symbolic links are not required to prohibit copying directories\n       to symbolic links. Other extensions to the System Interfaces\n       volume of POSIX.1\u20102017 file types may need to use this loophole\n       as well.",

        "description": "The C preprocessor, often known ascpp, is amacro processorthat\n       is used automatically by the C compiler to transform your program\n       before compilation.  It is called a macro processor because it\n       allows you to definemacros, which are brief abbreviations for\n       longer constructs.\n\n       The C preprocessor is intended to be used only with C, C++, and\n       Objective-C source code.  In the past, it has been abused as a\n       general text processor.  It will choke on input which does not\n       obey C's lexical rules.  For example, apostrophes will be\n       interpreted as the beginning of character constants, and cause\n       errors.  Also, you cannot rely on it preserving characteristics\n       of the input which are not significant to C-family languages.  If\n       a Makefile is preprocessed, all the hard tabs will be removed,\n       and the Makefile will not work.\n\n       Having said that, you can often get away with using cpp on things\n       which are not C.  Other Algol-ish programming languages are often\n       safe (Ada, etc.) So is assembly, with caution.-traditional-cppmode preserves more white space, and is otherwise more\n       permissive.  Many of the problems can be avoided by writing C or\n       C++ style comments instead of native language comments, and\n       keeping macros simple.\n\n       Wherever possible, you should use a preprocessor geared to the\n       language you are writing in.  Modern versions of the GNU\n       assembler have macro facilities.  Most high level programming\n       languages have their own conditional compilation and inclusion\n       mechanism.  If all else fails, try a true general text processor,\n       such as GNU M4.\n\n       C preprocessors vary in some details.  This manual discusses the\n       GNU C preprocessor, which provides a small superset of the\n       features of ISO Standard C.  In its default mode, the GNU C\n       preprocessor does not do a few things required by the standard.\n       These are features which are rarely, if ever, used, and may cause\n       surprising changes to the meaning of a program which does not\n       expect them.  To get strict ISO Standard C, you should use the-std=c90,-std=c99,-std=c11or-std=c17options, depending on\n       which version of the standard you want.  To get all the mandatory\n       diagnostics, you must also use-pedantic.\n\n       This manual describes the behavior of the ISO preprocessor.  To\n       minimize gratuitous differences, where the ISO preprocessor's\n       behavior does not conflict with traditional semantics, the\n       traditional preprocessor should behave the same way.  The various\n       differences that do exist are detailed in the sectionTraditionalMode.\n\n       For clarity, unless noted otherwise, references toCPPin this\n       manual refer to GNU CPP.",
        "options": "Thecppcommand expects two file names as arguments,infileandoutfile.  The preprocessor readsinfiletogether with any other\n       files it specifies with#include.

You can also use the-ooutfileoption to specify the output file.\n\n       Unless otherwise noted, or the option ends in=, all options\n       which take an argument may have that argument appear either\n       immediately after the option, or with a space between option and\n       argument:-Ifooand-I foohave the same effect.\n\n       Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-\n       letter options maynotbe grouped:-dMis very different from-d -M.-DnamePredefinenameas a macro, with definition 1.-Dname=definitionThe contents ofdefinitionare tokenized and processed as if\n           they appeared during translation phase three in a#definedirective.

Macros it defines remain\n           defined.  This allows you to acquire all the macros from a\n           header without also processing its declarations.\n\n           All files specified by-imacrosare processed before all\n           files specified by-include.-undefDo not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.\n           The standard predefined macros remain defined.-pthreadDefine additional macros required for using the POSIX threads\n           library.  You should use this option consistently for both\n           compilation and linking.  This option is supported on\n           GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives, and also on\n           x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.-MInstead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a\n           rule suitable formakedescribing the dependencies of the\n           main source file.  The preprocessor outputs onemakerule\n           containing the object file name for that source file, a\n           colon, and the names of all the included files, including\n           those coming from-includeor-imacroscommand-line options.\n\n           Unless specified explicitly (with-MTor-MQ), the object\n           file name consists of the name of the source file with any\n           suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading\n           directory parts removed.  If there are many included files\n           then the rule is split into several lines using\\-newline.\n           The rule has no commands.\n\n           This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug\n           output, such as-dM.  To avoid mixing such debug output with\n           the dependency rules you should explicitly specify the\n           dependency output file with-MF, or use an environment\n           variable likeDEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT.  Debug output is still\n           sent to the regular output stream as normal.\n\n           Passing-Mto the driver implies-E, and suppresses warnings\n           with an implicit-w.-MMLike-Mbut do not mention header files that are found in\n           system header directories, nor header files that are\n           included, directly or indirectly, from such a header.\n\n           This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double\n           quotes in an#includedirective does not in itself determine\n           whether that header appears in-MMdependency output.-MFfileWhen used with-Mor-MM, specifies a file to write the\n           dependencies to.  If no-MFswitch is given the preprocessor\n           sends the rules to the same place it would send preprocessed\n           output.\n\n           When used with the driver options-MDor-MMD,-MFoverrides\n           the default dependency output file.\n\n           Iffileis-, then the dependencies are written tostdout.-MGIn conjunction with an option such as-Mrequesting\n           dependency generation,-MGassumes missing header files are\n           generated files and adds them to the dependency list without\n           raising an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly\n           from the \"#include\" directive without prepending any path.-MGalso suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header\n           file renders this useless.\n\n           This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.-MPThis option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each\n           dependency other than the main file, causing each to depend\n           on nothing.  These dummy rules work around errorsmakegives\n           if you remove header files without updating theMakefileto\n           match.\n\n           This is typical output:\n\n                   test.o: test.c test.h\n\n                   test.h:-MTtargetChange the target of the rule emitted by dependency\n           generation.  By default CPP takes the name of the main input\n           file, deletes any directory components and any file suffix\n           such as.c, and appends the platform's usual object suffix.\n           The result is the target.\n\n           An-MToption sets the target to be exactly the string you\n           specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them\n           as a single argument to-MT, or use multiple-MToptions.\n\n           For example,-MT '$(objpfx)foo.o'might give\n\n                   $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c-MQtargetSame as-MT, but it quotes any characters which are special\n           to Make.-MQ '$(objpfx)foo.o'gives\n\n                   $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c\n\n           The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were\n           given with-MQ.-MD -MDis equivalent to-M -MFfile, except that-Eis not\n           implied.  The driver determinesfilebased on whether an-ooption is given.  If it is, the driver uses its argument but\n           with a suffix of.d, otherwise it takes the name of the input\n           file, removes any directory components and suffix, and\n           applies a.dsuffix.\n\n           If-MDis used in conjunction with-E, any-oswitch is\n           understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used\n           without-E, each-ois understood to specify a target object\n           file.\n\n           Since-Eis not implied,-MDcan be used to generate a\n           dependency output file as a side effect of the compilation\n           process.-MMDLike-MDexcept mention only user header files, not system\n           header files.-fpreprocessedIndicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already\n           been preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro\n           expansion, trigraph conversion, escaped newline splicing, and\n           processing of most directives.  The preprocessor still\n           recognizes and removes comments, so that you can pass a file\n           preprocessed with-Cto the compiler without problems.  In\n           this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than a\n           tokenizer for the front ends.-fpreprocessedis implicit if the input file has one of the\n           extensions.i,.iior.mi.  These are the extensions that GCC\n           uses for preprocessed files created by-save-temps.-fdirectives-onlyWhen preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand\n           macros.\n\n           The option's behavior depends on the-Eand-fpreprocessedoptions.\n\n           With-E, preprocessing is limited to the handling of\n           directives such as \"#define\", \"#ifdef\", and \"#error\".  Other\n           preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph\n           conversion are not performed.  In addition, the-dDoption is\n           implicitly enabled.\n\n           With-fpreprocessed, predefinition of command line and most\n           builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as \"__LINE__\", which\n           are contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This\n           enables compilation of files previously preprocessed with \"-E\n           -fdirectives-only\".\n\n           With both-Eand-fpreprocessed, the rules for-fpreprocessedtake precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of files\n           previously preprocessed with \"-E -fdirectives-only\".-fdollars-in-identifiersAccept$in identifiers.-fextended-identifiersAccept universal character names in identifiers.  This option\n           is enabled by default for C99 (and later C standard versions)\n           and C++.-fno-canonical-system-headersWhen preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with\n           canonicalization.-ftabstop=widthSet the distance between tab stops.  This helps the\n           preprocessor report correct column numbers in warnings or\n           errors, even if tabs appear on the line.  If the value is\n           less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is ignored.  The\n           default is 8.-ftrack-macro-expansion[=level]\n           Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This\n           allows the compiler to emit diagnostic about the current\n           macro expansion stack when a compilation error occurs in a\n           macro expansion. Using this option makes the preprocessor and\n           the compiler consume more memory. Thelevelparameter can be\n           used to choose the level of precision of token location\n           tracking thus decreasing the memory consumption if necessary.\n           Value0oflevelde-activates this option. Value1tracks\n           tokens locations in a degraded mode for the sake of minimal\n           memory overhead. In this mode all tokens resulting from the\n           expansion of an argument of a function-like macro have the\n           same location. Value2tracks tokens locations completely.\n           This value is the most memory hungry.  When this option is\n           given no argument, the default parameter value is2.\n\n           Note that \"-ftrack-macro-expansion=2\" is activated by\n           default.-fmacro-prefix-map=old=newWhen preprocessing files residing in directoryold, expand\n           the \"__FILE__\" and \"__BASE_FILE__\" macros as if the files\n           resided in directorynewinstead.  This can be used to change\n           an absolute path to a relative path by using.fornewwhich\n           can result in more reproducible builds that are location\n           independent.  This option also affects \"__builtin_FILE()\"\n           during compilation.  See also-ffile-prefix-map.-fexec-charset=charsetSet the execution character set, used for string and\n           character constants.  The default is UTF-8.charsetcan be\n           any encoding supported by the system's \"iconv\" library\n           routine.-fwide-exec-charset=charsetSet the wide execution character set, used for wide string\n           and character constants.  The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16,\n           whichever corresponds to the width of \"wchar_t\".  As with-fexec-charset,charsetcan be any encoding supported by the\n           system's \"iconv\" library routine; however, you will have\n           problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in \"wchar_t\".-finput-charset=charsetSet the input character set, used for translation from the\n           character set of the input file to the source character set\n           used by GCC.  If the locale does not specify, or GCC cannot\n           get this information from the locale, the default is UTF-8.\n           This can be overridden by either the locale or this command-\n           line option.  Currently the command-line option takes\n           precedence if there's a conflict.charsetcan be any\n           encoding supported by the system's \"iconv\" library routine.-fworking-directoryEnable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output\n           that let the compiler know the current working directory at\n           the time of preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the\n           preprocessor emits, after the initial linemarker, a second\n           linemarker with the current working directory followed by two\n           slashes.  GCC uses this directory, when it's present in the\n           preprocessed input, as the directory emitted as the current\n           working directory in some debugging information formats.\n           This option is implicitly enabled if debugging information is\n           enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated form-fno-working-directory.  If the-Pflag is present in the\n           command line, this option has no effect, since no \"#line\"\n           directives are emitted whatsoever.-Apredicate=answerMake an assertion with the predicatepredicateand answeranswer.  This form is preferred to the older form-Apredicate(answer), which is still supported, because it does\n           not use shell special characters.-A -predicate=answerCancel an assertion with the predicatepredicateand answeranswer.-CDo not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to\n           the output file, except for comments in processed directives,\n           which are deleted along with the directive.\n\n           You should be prepared for side effects when using-C; it\n           causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their\n           own right.  For example, comments appearing at the start of\n           what would be a directive line have the effect of turning\n           that line into an ordinary source line, since the first token\n           on the line is no longer a#.-CCDo not discard comments, including during macro expansion.\n           This is like-C, except that comments contained within macros\n           are also passed through to the output file where the macro is\n           expanded.\n\n           In addition to the side effects of the-Coption, the-CCoption causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to be\n           converted to C-style comments.  This is to prevent later use\n           of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder\n           of the source line.\n\n           The-CCoption is generally used to support lint comments.-PInhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the\n           preprocessor.  This might be useful when running the\n           preprocessor on something that is not C code, and will be\n           sent to a program which might be confused by the linemarkers.-traditional-traditional-cppTry to imitate the behavior of pre-standard C preprocessors,\n           as opposed to ISO C preprocessors.\n\n           Note that GCC does not otherwise attempt to emulate a pre-\n           standard C compiler, and these options are only supported\n           with the-Eswitch, or when invoking CPP explicitly.-trigraphsSupport ISO C trigraphs.  These are three-character\n           sequences, all starting with??, that are defined by ISO C to\n           stand for single characters.  For example,??/stands for\\,\n           so'??/n'is a character constant for a newline.\n\n           By default, GCC ignores trigraphs, but in standard-conforming\n           modes it converts them.  See the-stdand-ansioptions.-remapEnable special code to work around file systems which only\n           permit very short file names, such as MS-DOS.-HPrint the name of each header file used, in addition to other\n           normal activities.  Each name is indented to show how deep in\n           the#includestack it is.  Precompiled header files are also\n           printed, even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid\n           precompiled header file is printed with...xand a valid one\n           with...!.-dlettersSays to make debugging dumps during compilation as specified\n           byletters.  The flags documented here are those relevant to\n           the preprocessor.  Otherlettersare interpreted by the\n           compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of GCC, and\n           so are silently ignored.  If you specifyletterswhose\n           behavior conflicts, the result is undefined.-dMInstead of the normal output, generate a list of#definedirectives for all the macros defined during the\n               execution of the preprocessor, including predefined\n               macros.  This gives you a way of finding out what is\n               predefined in your version of the preprocessor.  Assuming\n               you have no filefoo.h, the command\n\n                       touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h\n\n               shows all the predefined macros.-dDLike-dMexcept in two respects: it doesnotinclude the\n               predefined macros, and it outputsboththe#definedirectives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds\n               of output go to the standard output file.-dNLike-dD, but emit only the macro names, not their\n               expansions.-dIOutput#includedirectives in addition to the result of\n               preprocessing.-dULike-dDexcept that only macros that are expanded, or\n               whose definedness is tested in preprocessor directives,\n               are output; the output is delayed until the use or test\n               of the macro; and#undefdirectives are also output for\n               macros tested but undefined at the time.-fdebug-cppThis option is only useful for debugging GCC.  When used from\n           CPP or with-E, it dumps debugging information about location\n           maps.  Every token in the output is preceded by the dump of\n           the map its location belongs to.\n\n           When used from GCC without-E, this option has no effect.-Idir-iquotedir-isystemdir-idirafterdirAdd the directorydirto the list of directories to be\n           searched for header files during preprocessing.\n\n           Ifdirbegins with=or $SYSROOT, then the=or $SYSROOT is\n           replaced by the sysroot prefix; see--sysrootand-isysroot.\n\n           Directories specified with-iquoteapply only to the quote\n           form of the directive, \"#include \"file\"\".  Directories\n           specified with-I,-isystem, or-idirafterapply to lookup\n           for both the \"#include \"file\"\"and \"#include <file>\"directives.\n\n           You can specify any number or combination of these options on\n           the command line to search for header files in several\n           directories.  The lookup order is as follows:\n\n           1.  For the quote form of the include directive, the\n               directory of the current file is searched first.\n\n           2.  For the quote form of the include directive, the\n               directories specified by-iquoteoptions are searched in\n               left-to-right order, as they appear on the command line.\n\n           3.  Directories specified with-Ioptions are scanned in\n               left-to-right order.\n\n           4.  Directories specified with-isystemoptions are scanned\n               in left-to-right order.\n\n           5.  Standard system directories are scanned.\n\n           6.  Directories specified with-idirafteroptions are scanned\n               in left-to-right order.\n\n           You can use-Ito override a system header file, substituting\n           your own version, since these directories are searched before\n           the standard system header file directories.  However, you\n           should not use this option to add directories that contain\n           vendor-supplied system header files; use-isystemfor that.\n\n           The-isystemand-idirafteroptions also mark the directory\n           as a system directory, so that it gets the same special\n           treatment that is applied to the standard system directories.\n\n           If a standard system include directory, or a directory\n           specified with-isystem, is also specified with-I, the-Ioption is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a\n           system directory at its normal position in the system include\n           chain.  This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy\n           system headers and the ordering for the \"#include_next\"\n           directive are not inadvertently changed.

(This option is used when building the C++\n           library.)-Wcomment-WcommentsWarn whenever a comment-start sequence/*appears in a/*comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a//comment.

Such identifiers are replaced with zero.-Wexpansion-to-definedWarn wheneverdefinedis encountered in the expansion of a\n           macro (including the case where the macro is expanded by an#ifdirective).  Such usage is not portable.

The preprocessor also warns if the macro has not\n           been used at the time it is redefined or undefined.\n\n           Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and\n           macros defined in include files are not warned about.Note:If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped\n           conditional blocks, then the preprocessor reports it as\n           unused.  To avoid the warning in such a case, you might\n           improve the scope of the macro's definition by, for example,\n           moving it into the first skipped block.  Alternatively, you\n           could provide a dummy use with something like:\n\n                   #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning\n                   #endif-Wno-endif-labelsDo not warn whenever an \"#else\" or an \"#endif\" are followed\n           by text.  This sometimes happens in older programs with code\n           of the form\n\n                   #if FOO\n                   ...\n                   #else FOO\n                   ...\n                   #endif FOO\n\n           The second and third \"FOO\" should be in comments.

For this purpose, use thecron.allowandcron.denyfiles.  If thecron.allowfile exists, a user must be\n       listed in it to be allowed to usecrontab.

The text about ``invoked as specified by this\n       volume of POSIX.1\u20102017'' means that the implementation may\n       provide extensions that allow these variables to be affected at\n       runtime, but that the user has to take explicit action in order\n       to access the extension, such as give a new option flag or modify\n       the format of the crontab entry.\n\n       A typical user error is to type onlycrontab; this causes the\n       system to wait for the new crontab entry on standard input. If\n       end-of-file is typed (generally <control>\u2010D), the crontab entry\n       is replaced by an empty file. In this case, the user should type\n       the interrupt character, which prevents the crontab entry from\n       being replaced.",

        "rationale": "The option list was significantly reduced from that provided by\n       historical implementations. The-Foption was omitted as\n       redundant, since it is the default. The-Boption was omitted as\n       being of very limited usefulness. The-toption was omitted since\n       the recognition oftypedefs is now required for C source files.\n       The-uoption was omitted because the update function was judged\n       to be not only inefficient, but also rarely needed.\n\n       An early proposal included a-woption to suppress warning\n       diagnostics. Since the types of such diagnostics could not be\n       described, the option was omitted as being not useful.\n\n       The text forLC_CTYPEabout compatibility with the C locale\n       acknowledges that the ISO C standard imposes requirements on the\n       locale used to process C source. This could easily be a superset\n       of that known as ``the C locale'' by way of implementation\n       extensions, or one of a few alternative locales for systems\n       supporting different codesets. No statement is made for FORTRAN\n       because the ANSI X3.9\u20101978 standard (FORTRAN 77) does not (yet)\n       define a similar locale concept. However, a general rule in this\n       volume of POSIX.1\u20102017 is that any time that locales do not match\n       (preparing a file for one locale and processing it in another),\n       the results are suspect.\n\n       The collation sequence of the tags file is not affected byLC_COLLATEbecause it is typically not used by human readers, but\n       only by programs such asvito locate the tag within the source\n       files. Using the POSIX locale eliminates some of the problems of\n       coordinating locales between thectagsfile creator and thevifile reader.\n\n       Historically, the tags file has been used only byexandvi.\n       However, the format of the tags file has been published to\n       encourage other programs to use the tags in new ways. The format\n       allows either patterns or line numbers to find the identifiers\n       because the historicalvirecognizes either. Thectagsutility\n       does not produce the format using line numbers because it is not\n       useful following any source file changes that add or delete\n       lines.  The documented search patterns match historical practice.\n       It should be noted that literal leading <circumflex> or trailing\n       <dollar-sign> characters in the search pattern will only behave\n       correctly if anchored to the beginning of the line or end of the\n       line by an additional <circumflex> or <dollar-sign> character.\n\n       Historical implementations also understand the objects used by\n       the languages Pascal and sometimes LISP, and they understand the\n       C source output bylexandyacc.  Thectagsutility is not\n       required to accommodate these languages, although implementors\n       are encouraged to do so.\n\n       The following historical option was not specified, asvgrindis\n       not included in this volume of POSIX.1\u20102017:-vIf the-vflag is given, an index of the form expected\n                 byvgrindis produced on the standard output. This\n                 listing contains the function name, filename, and page\n                 number (assuming 64-line pages). Since the output is\n                 sorted into lexicographic order, it may be desired to\n                 run the output throughsort-f.  Sample use:\n\n                     ctags -v files | sort -f > index vgrind -x index\n\n       The special treatment of the tagmainmakes the use ofctagspractical in directories with more than one program.",

        "synopsis": null,
        "description": "CUPSis the software you use to print from applications like word\n       processors, email readers, photo editors, and web browsers. It\n       converts the page descriptions produced by your application (put\n       a paragraph here, draw a line there, and so forth) into something\n       your printer can understand and then sends the information to the\n       printer for printing.\n\n       Now, since every printer manufacturer does things differently,\n       printing can be very complicated.CUPSdoes its best to hide\n       this from you and your application so that you can concentrate on\n       printing and less on how to print. Generally, the only time you\n       need to know anything about your printer is when you use it for\n       the first time, and even thenCUPScan often figure things out on\n       its own.HOW DOES IT WORK?The first time you print to a printer,CUPScreates a queue to\n       keep track of the current status of the printer (everything OK,\n       out of paper, etc.) and any pages you have printed. Most of the\n       time the queue points to a printer connected directly to your\n       computer via a USB port, however it can also point to a printer\n       on your network, a printer on the Internet, or multiple printers\n       depending on the configuration. Regardless of where the queue\n       points, it will look like any other printer to you and your\n       applications.\n\n       Every time you print something,CUPScreates a job which contains\n       the queue you are sending the print to, the name of the document\n       you are printing, and the page descriptions. Job are numbered\n       (queue-1, queue-2, and so forth) so you can monitor the job as it\n       is printed or cancel it if you see a mistake. WhenCUPSgets a\n       job for printing, it determines the best programs (filters,\n       printer drivers, port monitors, and backends) to convert the\n       pages into a printable format and then runs them to actually\n       print the job.\n\n       When the print job is completely printed,CUPSremoves the job\n       from the queue and moves on to any other jobs you have submitted.\n       You can also be notified when the job is finished, or if there\n       are any errors during printing, in several different ways.WHERE DO I BEGIN?The easiest way to start is by using the web interface to\n       configure your printer. Go to \"http://localhost:631\" and choose\n       the Administration tab at the top of the page. Click/press on the\n       Add Printer button and follow the prompts.\n\n       When you are asked for a username and password, enter your login\n       username and password or the \"root\" username and password.\n\n       After the printer is added you will be asked to set the default\n       printer options (paper size, output mode, etc.) for the printer.\n       Make any changes as needed and then click/press on the Set\n       Default Options button to save them. Some printers also support\n       auto-configuration - click/press on the Query Printer for Default\n       Options button to update the options automatically.\n\n       Once you have added the printer, you can print to it from any\n       application. You can also choose Print Test Page from the\n       maintenance menu to print a simple test page and verify that\n       everything is working properly.\n\n       You can also use thelpadmin(8)andlpinfo(8)commands to add\n       printers toCUPS.  Additionally, your operating system may\n       include graphical user interfaces or automatically create printer\n       queues when you connect a printer to your computer.HOW DO I GET HELP?TheCUPSweb site (http://www.CUPS.org) provides access to thecupsandcups-develmailing lists, additional documentation and\n       resources, and a bug report database. Most vendors also provide\n       online discussion forums to ask printing questions for your\n       operating system of choice.",

(Added in 7.13.0)\n\n       --ssl-backends\n              Lists the SSL backends that were enabled when libcurl was\n              built. It might be no, one or several names. If more than\n              one name, they appear comma-separated.  (Added in 7.58.0)\n\n       --static-libs\n              Shows the complete set of libs and other linker options\n              you need in order to link your application with libcurl\n              statically. (Added in 7.17.1)\n\n       --version\n              Outputs version information about the installed libcurl.\n\n       --vernum\n              Outputs version information about the installed libcurl,\n              in numerical mode.  This shows the version number, in\n              hexadecimal, using 8 bits for each part: major, minor, and\n              patch numbers. This makes libcurl 7.7.4 appear as 070704\n              and libcurl 12.13.14 appear as 0c0d0e... Note that the\n              initial zero might be omitted.

It supports these protocols: DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER,\n       GOPHERS, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3,\n       POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS,\n       TELNET, TFTP, WS and WSS.\n\n       curl is powered by libcurl for all transfer-related features. Seelibcurl(3) for details.",
        "options": "Options start with one or two dashes. Many of the options require\n       an additional value next to them. If provided text does not start\n       with a dash, it is presumed to be and treated as a URL.\n\n       The short \"single-dash\" form of the options, -d for example, may\n       be used with or without a space between it and its value,\n       although a space is a recommended separator. The long\n       \"double-dash\" form,-d, --datafor example, requires a space\n       between it and its value.\n\n       Short version options that do not need any additional values can\n       be used immediately next to each other, like for example you can\n       specify all the options-O,-Land-vat once as-OLv.\n\n       In general, all boolean options are enabled with --optionand yet\n       again disabled with --no-option. That is, you use the same option\n       name but prefix it with \"no-\". However, in this list we mostly\n       only list and show the--optionversion of them.\n\n       When-:, --nextis used, it resets the parser state and you start\n       again with a clean option state, except for the options that are\n       \"global\". Global options retain their values and meaning even\n       after-:, --next.\n\n       The following options are global:--fail-early,--libcurl,--parallel-immediate,-Z, --parallel,-#, --progress-bar,--rate,-S, --show-error,--stderr,--styled-output,--trace-ascii,--trace-config,--trace-ids,--trace-time,--traceand-v,--verbose.\n\n       --abstract-unix-socket <path>\n              (HTTP) Connect through an abstract Unix domain socket,\n              instead of using the network.  Note: netstat shows the\n              path of an abstract socket prefixed with '@', however the\n              <path> argument should not have this leading character.\n\n              If--abstract-unix-socketis provided several times, the\n              last set value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --abstract-unix-socket socketpathhttps://example.comSee also--unix-socket. Added in 7.53.0.\n\n       --alt-svc <file name>\n              (HTTPS) This option enables the alt-svc parser in curl. If\n              the file name points to an existing alt-svc cache file,\n              that gets used. After a completed transfer, the cache is\n              saved to the file name again if it has been modified.\n\n              Specify a \"\" file name (zero length) to avoid\n              loading/saving and make curl just handle the cache in\n              memory.\n\n              If this option is used several times, curl loads contents\n              from all the files but the last one is used for saving.--alt-svccan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Example:\n               curl --alt-svc svc.txthttps://example.comSee also--resolveand--connect-to. Added in 7.64.1.\n\n       --anyauth\n              (HTTP) Tells curl to figure out authentication method by\n              itself, and use the most secure one the remote site claims\n              to support. This is done by first doing a request and\n              checking the response-headers, thus possibly inducing an\n              extra network round-trip. This is used instead of setting\n              a specific authentication method, which you can do with--basic,--digest,--ntlm, and--negotiate.\n\n              Using--anyauthis not recommended if you do uploads from\n              stdin, since it may require data to be sent twice and then\n              the client must be able to rewind. If the need should\n              arise when uploading from stdin, the upload operation\n              fails.\n\n              Used together with-u, --user.\n\n              Providing--anyauthmultiple times has no extra effect.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --anyauth --user me:pwdhttps://example.comSee also--proxy-anyauth,--basicand--digest.\n\n       -a, --append\n              (FTP SFTP) When used in an upload, this option makes curl\n              append to the target file instead of overwriting it. If\n              the remote file does not exist, it is created. Note that\n              this flag is ignored by some SFTP servers (including\n              OpenSSH).\n\n              Providing-a, --appendmultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --no-append.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --upload-file local --append ftp://example.com/\n\n              See also-r, --rangeand-C, --continue-at.\n\n       --aws-sigv4 <provider1[:provider2[:region[:service]]]>\n              (HTTP) Use AWS V4 signature authentication in the\n              transfer.\n\n              The provider argument is a string that is used by the\n              algorithm when creating outgoing authentication headers.\n\n              The region argument is a string that points to a\n              geographic area of a resources collection (region-code)\n              when the region name is omitted from the endpoint.\n\n              The service argument is a string that points to a function\n              provided by a cloud (service-code) when the service name\n              is omitted from the endpoint.\n\n              If--aws-sigv4is provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --aws-sigv4 \"aws:amz:us-east-2:es\" --user \"key:secret\"https://example.comSee also--basicand-u, --user. Added in 7.75.0.\n\n       --basic\n              (HTTP) Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication with\n              the remote host. This is the default and this option is\n              usually pointless, unless you use it to override a\n              previously set option that sets a different authentication\n              method (such as--ntlm,--digest, or--negotiate).\n\n              Used together with-u, --user.\n\n              Providing--basicmultiple times has no extra effect.\n\n              Example:\n               curl -u name:password --basichttps://example.comSee also--proxy-basic.\n\n       --ca-native\n              (TLS) Tells curl to use the CA store from the native\n              operating system to verify the peer. By default, curl\n              otherwise uses a CA store provided in a single file or\n              directory, but when using this option it interfaces the\n              operating system's own vault.\n\n              This option only works for curl on Windows when built to\n              use OpenSSL. When curl on Windows is built to use\n              Schannel, this feature is implied and curl then only uses\n              the native CA store.\n\n              curl built with wolfSSL also supports this option (added\n              in 8.3.0).\n\n              Providing--ca-nativemultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --no-ca-native.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --ca-nativehttps://example.comSee also--cacert,--capathand-k, --insecure. Added in\n              8.2.0.\n\n       --cacert <file>\n              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate file to\n              verify the peer. The file may contain multiple CA\n              certificates. The certificate(s) must be in PEM format.\n              Normally curl is built to use a default file for this, so\n              this option is typically used to alter that default file.\n\n              curl recognizes the environment variable named\n              'CURL_CA_BUNDLE' if it is set, and uses the given path as\n              a path to a CA cert bundle. This option overrides that\n              variable.\n\n              The windows version of curl automatically looks for a CA\n              certs file named 'curl-ca-bundle.crt', either in the same\n              directory as curl.exe, or in the Current Working\n              Directory, or in any folder along your PATH.\n\n              (iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure\n              Transport, then this option is supported for backward\n              compatibility with other SSL engines, but it should not be\n              set. If the option is not set, then curl uses the\n              certificates in the system and user Keychain to verify the\n              peer, which is the preferred method of verifying the\n              peer's certificate chain.\n\n              (Schannel only) This option is supported for Schannel in\n              Windows 7 or later (added in 7.60.0). This option is\n              supported for backward compatibility with other SSL\n              engines; instead it is recommended to use Windows' store\n              of root certificates (the default for Schannel).\n\n              If--cacertis provided several times, the last set value\n              is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --cacert CA-file.txthttps://example.comSee also--capathand-k, --insecure.\n\n       --capath <dir>\n              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified certificate\n              directory to verify the peer. Multiple paths can be\n              provided by separating them with \":\" (e.g.\n              \"path1:path2:path3\"). The certificates must be in PEM\n              format, and if curl is built against OpenSSL, the\n              directory must have been processed using the c_rehash\n              utility supplied with OpenSSL. Using--capathcan allow\n              OpenSSL-powered curl to make SSL-connections much more\n              efficiently than using--cacertif the--cacertfile\n              contains many CA certificates.\n\n              If this option is set, the default capath value is\n              ignored.\n\n              If--capathis provided several times, the last set value\n              is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --capath /local/directoryhttps://example.comSee also--cacertand-k, --insecure.\n\n       -E, --cert <certificate[:password]>\n              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified client certificate\n              file when getting a file with HTTPS, FTPS or another\n              SSL-based protocol. The certificate must be in PKCS#12\n              format if using Secure Transport, or PEM format if using\n              any other engine. If the optional password is not\n              specified, it is queried for on the terminal. Note that\n              this option assumes a certificate file that is the private\n              key and the client certificate concatenated. See-E,--certand--keyto specify them independently.\n\n              In the <certificate> portion of the argument, you must\n              escape the character \":\" as \"\\:\" so that it is not\n              recognized as the password delimiter. Similarly, you must\n              escape the character \"\\\" as \"\\\\\" so that it is not\n              recognized as an escape character.\n\n              If curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine\n              pkcs11 is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be\n              used to specify a certificate located in a PKCS#11 device.\n              A string beginning with \"pkcs11:\" is interpreted as a\n              PKCS#11 URI. If a PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the--engineoption is set as \"pkcs11\" if none was provided\n              and the--cert-typeoption is set as \"ENG\" if none was\n              provided.\n\n              (iOS and macOS only) If curl is built against Secure\n              Transport, then the certificate string can either be the\n              name of a certificate/private key in the system or user\n              keychain, or the path to a PKCS#12-encoded certificate and\n              private key. If you want to use a file from the current\n              directory, please precede it with \"./\" prefix, in order to\n              avoid confusion with a nickname.\n\n              (Schannel only) Client certificates must be specified by a\n              path expression to a certificate store. (LoadingPFXis\n              not supported; you can import it to a store first). You\n              can use \"<store location>\\<store name>\\<thumbprint>\" to\n              refer to a certificate in the system certificates store,\n              for example,\"CurrentUser\\MY\\934a7ac6f8a5d579285a74fa61e19f23ddfe8d7a\".\n              Thumbprint is usually a SHA-1 hex string which you can see\n              in certificate details. Following store locations are\n              supported:CurrentUser,LocalMachine,CurrentService,Services,CurrentUserGroupPolicy,LocalMachineGroupPolicyandLocalMachineEnterprise.\n\n              If-E, --certis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --cert certfile --key keyfilehttps://example.comSee also--cert-type,--keyand--key-type.\n\n       --cert-status\n              (TLS) Tells curl to verify the status of the server\n              certificate by using the Certificate Status Request (aka.\n              OCSP stapling) TLS extension.\n\n              If this option is enabled and the server sends an invalid\n              (e.g. expired) response, if the response suggests that the\n              server certificate has been revoked, or no response at all\n              is received, the verification fails.\n\n              This is currently only implemented in the OpenSSL and\n              GnuTLS backends.\n\n              Providing--cert-statusmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --no-cert-status.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --cert-statushttps://example.comSee also--pinnedpubkey.\n\n       --cert-type <type>\n              (TLS) Tells curl what type the provided client certificate\n              is using. PEM, DER, ENG and P12 are recognized types.\n\n              The default type depends on the TLS backend and is usually\n              PEM, however for Secure Transport and Schannel it is P12.\n              If-E, --certis a pkcs11: URI then ENG is the default\n              type.\n\n              If--cert-typeis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --cert-type PEM --cert filehttps://example.comSee also-E, --cert,--keyand--key-type.\n\n       --ciphers <list of ciphers>\n              (TLS) Specifies which ciphers to use in the connection.\n              The list of ciphers must specify valid ciphers. Read up on\n              SSL cipher list details on this URL:https://curl.se/docs/ssl-ciphers.htmlIf--ciphersis provided several times, the last set value\n              is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-CCM8https://example.comSee also--tlsv1.3,--tls13-ciphersand--proxy-ciphers.\n\n       --compressed\n              (HTTP) Request a compressed response using one of the\n              algorithms curl supports, and automatically decompress the\n              content.\n\n              Response headers are not modified when saved, so if they\n              are \"interpreted\" separately again at a later point they\n              might appear to be saying that the content is (still)\n              compressed; while in fact it has already been\n              decompressed.\n\n              If this option is used and the server sends an unsupported\n              encoding, curl reports an error. This is a request, not an\n              order; the server may or may not deliver data compressed.\n\n              Providing--compressedmultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --no-compressed.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --compressedhttps://example.comSee also--compressed-ssh.\n\n       --compressed-ssh\n              (SCP SFTP) Enables built-in SSH compression.  This is a\n              request, not an order; the server may or may not do it.\n\n              Providing--compressed-sshmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.

The\n              command line arguments found in the text file are used as\n              if they were provided on the command line.\n\n              Options and their parameters must be specified on the same\n              line in the file, separated by whitespace, colon, or the\n              equals sign. Long option names can optionally be given in\n              the config file without the initial double dashes and if\n              so, the colon or equals characters can be used as\n              separators. If the option is specified with one or two\n              dashes, there can be no colon or equals character between\n              the option and its parameter.\n\n              If the parameter contains whitespace or starts with a\n              colon (:) or equals sign (=), it must be specified\n              enclosed within double quotes (\"). Within double quotes\n              the following escape sequences are available: \\\\, \\\", \\t,\n              \\n, \\r and \\v. A backslash preceding any other letter is\n              ignored.\n\n              If the first non-blank column of a config line is a '#'\n              character, that line is treated as a comment.\n\n              Only write one option per physical line in the config\n              file. A single line is required to be no more than 10\n              megabytes (since 8.2.0).\n\n              Specify the filename to-K, --configas '-' to make curl\n              read the file from stdin.\n\n              Note that to be able to specify a URL in the config file,\n              you need to specify it using the--urloption, and not by\n              simply writing the URL on its own line. So, it could look\n              similar to this:\n\n              url = \"https://curl.se/docs/\"\n\n               # --- Example file ---\n               # this is a comment\n               url = \"example.com\"\n               output = \"curlhere.html\"\n               user-agent = \"superagent/1.0\"\n\n               # and fetch another URL too\n               url = \"example.com/docs/manpage.html\"\n               -O\n               referer = \"http://nowhereatall.example.com/\"\n               # --- End of example file ---\n\n              When curl is invoked, it (unless-q, --disableis used)\n              checks for a default config file and uses it if found,\n              even when-K, --configis used. The default config file is\n              checked for in the following places in this order:\n\n              1)\"$CURL_HOME/.curlrc\"2)\"$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/curlrc\"(Added in 7.73.0)\n\n              3)\"$HOME/.curlrc\"4) Windows:\"%USERPROFILE%\\.curlrc\"5) Windows:\"%APPDATA%\\.curlrc\"6) Windows: \"%USERPROFILE%\\Application Data\\.curlrc\"\n\n              7) Non-Windows: use getpwuid to find the home directory\n\n              8) On Windows, if it finds no.curlrcfile in the sequence\n              described above, it checks for one in the same dir the\n              curl executable is placed.\n\n              On Windows two filenames are checked per location:.curlrcand_curlrc, preferring the former. Older versions on\n              Windows checked for_curlrconly.-K, --configcan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Example:\n               curl --config file.txthttps://example.comSee also-q, --disable.\n\n       --connect-timeout <fractional seconds>\n              Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl's connection\n              to take.  This only limits the connection phase, so if\n              curl connects within the given period it continues - if\n              not it exits.\n\n              This option accepts decimal values. The decimal value\n              needs to be provided using a dot (.) as decimal separator\n              - not the local version even if it might be using another\n              separator.\n\n              The connection phase is considered complete when the DNS\n              lookup and requested TCP, TLS or QUIC handshakes are done.\n\n              If--connect-timeoutis provided several times, the last\n              set value is used.\n\n              Examples:\n               curl --connect-timeout 20https://example.comcurl --connect-timeout 3.14https://example.comSee also-m, --max-time.\n\n       --connect-to <HOST1:PORT1:HOST2:PORT2>\n\n              For a request to the given HOST1:PORT1 pair, connect to\n              HOST2:PORT2 instead.  This option is suitable to direct\n              requests at a specific server, e.g. at a specific cluster\n              node in a cluster of servers. This option is only used to\n              establish the network connection. It does NOT affect the\n              hostname/port that is used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI,\n              certificate verification) or for the application\n              protocols. \"HOST1\" and \"PORT1\" may be the empty string,\n              meaning \"any host/port\". \"HOST2\" and \"PORT2\" may also be\n              the empty string, meaning \"use the request's original\n              host/port\".\n\n              A \"host\" specified to this option is compared as a string,\n              so it needs to match the name used in request URL. It can\n              be either numerical such as \"127.0.0.1\" or the full host\n              name such as \"example.org\".--connect-tocan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Example:\n               curl --connect-to example.com:443:example.net:8443https://example.comSee also--resolveand-H, --header.\n\n       -C, --continue-at <offset>\n              Continue/Resume a previous file transfer at the given\n              offset. The given offset is the exact number of bytes that\n              are skipped, counting from the beginning of the source\n              file before it is transferred to the destination. If used\n              with uploads, the FTP server command SIZE is not used by\n              curl.\n\n              Use \"-C -\" to tell curl to automatically find out\n              where/how to resume the transfer. It then uses the given\n              output/input files to figure that out.\n\n              If-C, --continue-atis provided several times, the last\n              set value is used.\n\n              Examples:\n               curl -C -https://example.comcurl -C 400https://example.comSee also-r, --range.\n\n       -b, --cookie <data|filename>\n              (HTTP) Pass the data to the HTTP server in the Cookie\n              header. It is supposedly the data previously received from\n              the server in a \"Set-Cookie:\" line. The data should be in\n              the format \"NAME1=VALUE1; NAME2=VALUE2\". This makes curl\n              use the cookie header with this content explicitly in all\n              outgoing request(s). If multiple requests are done due to\n              authentication, followed redirects or similar, they all\n              get this cookie passed on.\n\n              If no '=' symbol is used in the argument, it is instead\n              treated as a filename to read previously stored cookie\n              from. This option also activates the cookie engine which\n              makes curl record incoming cookies, which may be handy if\n              you are using this in combination with the-L, --locationoption or do multiple URL transfers on the same invoke. If\n              the file name is exactly a minus (\"-\"), curl instead reads\n              the contents from stdin.\n\n              The file format of the file to read cookies from should be\n              plain HTTP headers (Set-Cookie style) or the\n              Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format.\n\n              The file specified with-b, --cookieis only used as\n              input. No cookies are written to the file. To store\n              cookies, use the-c, --cookie-jaroption.\n\n              If you use the Set-Cookie file format and do not specify a\n              domain then the cookie is not sent since the domain never\n              matches. To address this, set a domain in Set-Cookie line\n              (doing that includes subdomains) or preferably: use the\n              Netscape format.\n\n              Users often want to both read cookies from a file and\n              write updated cookies back to a file, so using both-b,--cookieand-c, --cookie-jarin the same command line is\n              common.-b, --cookiecan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Examples:\n               curl -b cookiefilehttps://example.comcurl -b cookiefile -c cookiefilehttps://example.comSee also-c, --cookie-jarand-j, --junk-session-cookies.\n\n       -c, --cookie-jar <filename>\n              (HTTP) Specify to which file you want curl to write all\n              cookies after a completed operation. Curl writes all\n              cookies from its in-memory cookie storage to the given\n              file at the end of operations. If no cookies are known, no\n              data is written. The file is created using the Netscape\n              cookie file format. If you set the file name to a single\n              dash, \"-\", the cookies are written to stdout.\n\n              The file specified with-c, --cookie-jaris only used for\n              output. No cookies are read from the file. To read\n              cookies, use the-b, --cookieoption. Both options can\n              specify the same file.\n\n              This command line option activates the cookie engine that\n              makes curl record and use cookies. The-b, --cookieoption\n              also activates it.\n\n              If the cookie jar cannot be created or written to, the\n              whole curl operation does not fail or even report an error\n              clearly. Using-v, --verbosegets a warning displayed, but\n              that is the only visible feedback you get about this\n              possibly lethal situation.\n\n              If-c, --cookie-jaris provided several times, the last\n              set value is used.\n\n              Examples:\n               curl -c store-here.txthttps://example.comcurl -c store-here.txt -b read-thesehttps://example.comSee also-b, --cookie.\n\n       --create-dirs\n              When used in conjunction with the-o, --outputoption,\n              curl creates the necessary local directory hierarchy as\n              needed. This option creates the directories mentioned with\n              the-o, --outputoption combined with the path possibly\n              set with--output-dir. If the combined output file name\n              uses no directory, or if the directories it mentions\n              already exist, no directories are created.\n\n              Created directories are made with mode 0750 on unix style\n              file systems.\n\n              To create remote directories when using FTP or SFTP, try--ftp-create-dirs.\n\n              Providing--create-dirsmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --no-create-dirs.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --create-dirs --output local/dir/filehttps://example.comSee also--ftp-create-dirsand--output-dir.\n\n       --create-file-mode <mode>\n              (SFTP SCP FILE) When curl is used to create files remotely\n              using one of the supported protocols, this option allows\n              the user to set which 'mode' to set on the file at\n              creation time, instead of the default 0644.\n\n              This option takes an octal number as argument.\n\n              If--create-file-modeis provided several times, the last\n              set value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --create-file-mode 0777 -T localfile sftp://example.com/new\n\n              See also--ftp-create-dirs.

Useful for MVS (OS/390).\n\n              (SMTP added in 7.40.0)\n\n              Providing--crlfmultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --no-crlf.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --crlf -T file ftp://example.com/\n\n              See also-B, --use-ascii.\n\n       --crlfile <file>\n              (TLS) Provide a file using PEM format with a Certificate\n              Revocation List that may specify peer certificates that\n              are to be considered revoked.\n\n              If--crlfileis provided several times, the last set value\n              is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --crlfile rejects.txthttps://example.comSee also--cacertand--capath.\n\n       --curves <algorithm list>\n              (TLS) Tells curl to request specific curves to use during\n              SSL session establishment according to RFC 8422, 5.1.\n              Multiple algorithms can be provided by separating them\n              with \":\" (e.g.  \"X25519:P-521\").  The parameter is\n              available identically in the \"openssl s_client/s_server\"\n              utilities.--curvesallows a OpenSSL powered curl to make\n              SSL-connections with exactly the (EC) curve requested by\n              the client, avoiding nontransparent client/server\n              negotiations.\n\n              If this option is set, the default curves list built into\n              OpenSSL are ignored.\n\n              If--curvesis provided several times, the last set value\n              is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --curves X25519https://example.comSee also--ciphers. Added in 7.73.0.\n\n       -d, --data <data>\n              (HTTP MQTT) Sends the specified data in a POST request to\n              the HTTP server, in the same way that a browser does when\n              a user has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit\n              button. This makes curl pass the data to the server using\n              the content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded.\n              Compare to-F, --form.--data-rawis almost the same but does not have a special\n              interpretation of the @ character. To post data purely\n              binary, you should instead use the--data-binaryoption.\n              To URL-encode the value of a form field you may use--data-urlencode.\n\n              If any of these options is used more than once on the same\n              command line, the data pieces specified are merged with a\n              separating &-symbol. Thus, using '-d name=daniel -d\n              skill=lousy' would generate a post chunk that looks like\n              'name=daniel&skill=lousy'.\n\n              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should\n              be a file name to read the data from, or - if you want\n              curl to read the data from stdin. Posting data from a file\n              named 'foobar' would thus be done with-d, --data@foobar.\n              When-d, --datais told to read from a file like that,\n              carriage returns and newlines are stripped out. If you do\n              not want the @ character to have a special interpretation\n              use--data-rawinstead.\n\n              The data for this option is passed on to the server\n              exactly as provided on the command line. curl does not\n              convert, change or improve it. It is up to the user to\n              provide the data in the correct form.-d, --datacan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Examples:\n               curl -d \"name=curl\"https://example.comcurl -d \"name=curl\" -d \"tool=cmdline\"https://example.comcurl -d @filenamehttps://example.comSee also--data-binary,--data-urlencodeand--data-raw.\n              This option is mutually exclusive to-F, --formand-I,--headand-T, --upload-file.\n\n       --data-ascii <data>\n              (HTTP) This is just an alias for-d, --data.--data-asciican be used several times in a command line\n\n              Example:\n               curl --data-ascii @filehttps://example.comSee also--data-binary,--data-rawand--data-urlencode.\n\n       --data-binary <data>\n              (HTTP) This posts data exactly as specified with no extra\n              processing whatsoever.\n\n              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should\n              be a filename. Data is posted in a similar manner as-d,--datadoes, except that newlines and carriage returns are\n              preserved and conversions are never done.\n\n              Like-d, --datathe default content-type sent to the\n              server is application/x-www-form-urlencoded. If you want\n              the data to be treated as arbitrary binary data by the\n              server then set the content-type to octet-stream: -H\n              \"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\".\n\n              If this option is used several times, the ones following\n              the first append data as described in-d, --data.--data-binarycan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Example:\n               curl --data-binary @filenamehttps://example.comSee also--data-ascii.\n\n       --data-raw <data>\n              (HTTP) This posts data similarly to-d, --databut without\n              the special interpretation of the @ character.--data-rawcan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Examples:\n               curl --data-raw \"hello\"https://example.comcurl --data-raw \"@at@at@\"https://example.comSee also-d, --data.\n\n       --data-urlencode <data>\n              (HTTP) This posts data, similar to the other-d, --dataoptions with the exception that this performs\n              URL-encoding.\n\n              To be CGI-compliant, the <data> part should begin with anamefollowed by a separator and a content specification.\n              The <data> part can be passed to curl using one of the\n              following syntaxes:\n\n              content\n                     This makes curl URL-encode the content and pass\n                     that on. Just be careful so that the content does\n                     not contain any = or @ symbols, as that makes the\n                     syntax match one of the other cases below!\n\n              =content\n                     This makes curl URL-encode the content and pass\n                     that on.

Curl normally\n              first attempts to use EPRT before using PORT, but with\n              this option, it uses PORT right away. EPRT is an extension\n              to the original FTP protocol, and does not work on all\n              servers, but enables more functionality in a better way\n              than the traditional PORT command.\n\n              --eprt can be used to explicitly enable EPRT again and\n              --no-eprt is an alias for--disable-eprt.\n\n              If the server is accessed using IPv6, this option has no\n              effect as EPRT is necessary then.\n\n              Disabling EPRT only changes the active behavior. If you\n              want to switch to passive mode you need to not use-P,--ftp-portor force it with--ftp-pasv.\n\n              Providing--disable-eprtmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.

This is probably most useful when the URL is\n              being provided at runtime or similar.\n\n              Providing--disallow-username-in-urlmultiple times has no\n              extra effect.  Disable it again with\n              --no-disallow-username-in-url.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --disallow-username-in-urlhttps://example.comSee also--proto.

This option is a counterpart to--interface(which does not affect DNS). The supplied string must be\n              an interface name (not an address).\n\n              If--dns-interfaceis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --dns-interface eth0https://example.comSee also--dns-ipv4-addrand--dns-ipv6-addr.--dns-interfacerequires that the underlying libcurl was\n              built to support c-ares.\n\n       --dns-ipv4-addr <address>\n              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to a specific IP address when\n              making IPv4 DNS requests, so that the DNS requests\n              originate from this address. The argument should be a\n              single IPv4 address.\n\n              If--dns-ipv4-addris provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --dns-ipv4-addr 10.1.2.3https://example.comSee also--dns-interfaceand--dns-ipv6-addr.--dns-ipv4-addrrequires that the underlying libcurl was\n              built to support c-ares.\n\n       --dns-ipv6-addr <address>\n              (DNS) Tell curl to bind to a specific IP address when\n              making IPv6 DNS requests, so that the DNS requests\n              originate from this address.

Use--enginelist to print a list of\n              build-time supported engines. Note that not all (and\n              possibly none) of the engines may be available at runtime.\n\n              If--engineis provided several times, the last set value\n              is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --engine flavorhttps://example.comSee also--ciphersand--curves.\n\n       --etag-compare <file>\n              (HTTP) This option makes a conditional HTTP request for\n              the specific ETag read from the given file by sending a\n              custom If-None-Match header using the stored ETag.\n\n              For correct results, make sure that the specified file\n              contains only a single line with the desired ETag. An\n              empty file is parsed as an empty ETag.\n\n              Use the option--etag-saveto first save the ETag from a\n              response, and then use this option to compare against the\n              saved ETag in a subsequent request.\n\n              If--etag-compareis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --etag-compare etag.txthttps://example.comSee also--etag-saveand-z, --time-cond. Added in 7.68.0.\n\n       --etag-save <file>\n              (HTTP) This option saves an HTTP ETag to the specified\n              file. An ETag is a caching related header, usually\n              returned in a response.\n\n              If no ETag is sent by the server, an empty file is\n              created.\n\n              If--etag-saveis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --etag-save storetag.txthttps://example.comSee also--etag-compare. Added in 7.68.0.\n\n       --expect100-timeout <seconds>\n              (HTTP) Maximum time in seconds that you allow curl to wait\n              for a 100-continue response when curl emits an Expects:\n              100-continue header in its request. By default curl waits\n              one second. This option accepts decimal values! When curl\n              stops waiting, it continues as if the response has been\n              received.\n\n              The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.) as\n              decimal separator - not the local version even if it might\n              be using another separator.\n\n              If--expect100-timeoutis provided several times, the last\n              set value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --expect100-timeout 2.5 -T filehttps://example.comSee also--connect-timeout.\n\n       -f, --fail\n              (HTTP) Fail fast with no output at all on server errors.\n              This is useful to enable scripts and users to better deal\n              with failed attempts. In normal cases when an HTTP server\n              fails to deliver a document, it returns an HTML document\n              stating so (which often also describes why and more). This\n              flag prevents curl from outputting that and return error\n              22.\n\n              This method is not fail-safe and there are occasions where\n              non-successful response codes slip through, especially\n              when authentication is involved (response codes 401 and\n              407).\n\n              Providing-f, --failmultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --no-fail.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --failhttps://example.comSee also--fail-with-bodyand--fail-early. This option is\n              mutually exclusive to--fail-with-body.\n\n       --fail-early\n              Fail and exit on the first detected transfer error.\n\n              When curl is used to do multiple transfers on the command\n              line, it attempts to operate on each given URL, one by\n              one. By default, it ignores errors if there are more URLs\n              given and the last URL's success determines the error code\n              curl returns. So early failures are \"hidden\" by subsequent\n              successful transfers.\n\n              Using this option, curl instead returns an error on the\n              first transfer that fails, independent of the amount of\n              URLs that are given on the command line. This way, no\n              transfer failures go undetected by scripts and similar.\n\n              This option does not imply-f, --fail, which causes\n              transfers to fail due to the server's HTTP status code.\n              You can combine the two options, however note-f, --failis not global and is therefore contained by-:, --next.\n\n              This option is global and does not need to be specified\n              for each use of --next.\n\n              Providing--fail-earlymultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --no-fail-early.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --fail-earlyhttps://example.comhttps://two.exampleSee also-f, --failand--fail-with-body. Added in 7.52.0.\n\n       --fail-with-body\n              (HTTP) Return an error on server errors where the HTTP\n              response code is 400 or greater). In normal cases when an\n              HTTP server fails to deliver a document, it returns an\n              HTML document stating so (which often also describes why\n              and more). This flag allows curl to output and save that\n              content but also to return error 22.\n\n              This is an alternative option to-f, --failwhich makes\n              curl fail for the same circumstances but without saving\n              the content.\n\n              Providing--fail-with-bodymultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --no-fail-with-body.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --fail-with-bodyhttps://example.comSee also-f, --failand--fail-early. This option is\n              mutually exclusive to-f, --fail. Added in 7.76.0.\n\n       --false-start\n              (TLS) Tells curl to use false start during the TLS\n              handshake. False start is a mode where a TLS client starts\n              sending application data before verifying the server's\n              Finished message, thus saving a round trip when performing\n              a full handshake.\n\n              This is currently only implemented in the Secure Transport\n              (on iOS 7.0 or later, or OS X 10.9 or later) backend.\n\n              Providing--false-startmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --no-false-start.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --false-starthttps://example.comSee also--tcp-fastopen.\n\n       -F, --form <name=content>\n              (HTTP SMTP IMAP) For HTTP protocol family, this lets curl\n              emulate a filled-in form in which a user has pressed the\n              submit button. This causes curl to POST data using the\n              Content-Type multipart/form-data according to RFC 2388.\n\n              For SMTP and IMAP protocols, this is the means to compose\n              a multipart mail message to transmit.\n\n              This enables uploading of binary files etc. To force the\n              'content' part to be a file, prefix the file name with an\n              @ sign. To just get the content part from a file, prefix\n              the file name with the symbol <. The difference between @\n              and < is then that @ makes a file get attached in the post\n              as a file upload, while the < makes a text field and just\n              get the contents for that text field from a file.\n\n              Tell curl to read content from stdin instead of a file by\n              using - as filename. This goes for both @ and <\n              constructs. When stdin is used, the contents is buffered\n              in memory first by curl to determine its size and allow a\n              possible resend. Defining a part's data from a named\n              non-regular file (such as a named pipe or similar) is not\n              subject to buffering and is instead read at transmission\n              time; since the full size is unknown before the transfer\n              starts, such data is sent as chunks by HTTP and rejected\n              by IMAP.\n\n              Example: send an image to an HTTP server, where 'profile'\n              is the name of the form-field to which the fileportrait.jpgis the input:\n\n               curl -F profile=@portrait.jpghttps://example.com/upload.cgiExample: send your name and shoe size in two text fields\n              to the server:\n\n               curl -F name=John -F shoesize=11https://example.com/Example: send your essay in a text field to the server.\n              Send it as a plain text field, but get the contents for it\n              from a local file:\n\n               curl -F \"story=<hugefile.txt\"https://example.com/You can also tell curl what Content-Type to use by using\n              'type=', in a manner similar to:\n\n               curl -F \"web=@index.html;type=text/html\" example.com\n\n              or\n\n               curl -F \"name=daniel;type=text/foo\" example.com\n\n              You can also explicitly change the name field of a file\n              upload part by setting filename=, like this:\n\n               curl -F \"file=@localfile;filename=nameinpost\" example.com\n\n              If filename/path contains ',' or ';', it must be quoted by\n              double-quotes like:\n\n               curl -F \"file=@\\\"local,file\\\";filename=\\\"name;in;post\\\"\" example.com\n\n              or\n\n               curl -F 'file=@\"local,file\";filename=\"name;in;post\"' example.com\n\n              Note that if a filename/path is quoted by double-quotes,\n              any double-quote or backslash within the filename must be\n              escaped by backslash.\n\n              Quoting must also be applied to non-file data if it\n              contains semicolons, leading/trailing spaces or leading\n              double quotes:\n\n               curl -F 'colors=\"red; green; blue\";type=text/x-myapp' example.com\n\n              You can add custom headers to the field by setting\n              headers=, like\n\n                curl -F \"submit=OK;headers=\\\"X-submit-type: OK\\\"\" example.com\n\n              or\n\n                curl -F \"submit=OK;headers=@headerfile\" example.com\n\n              The headers= keyword may appear more that once and above\n              notes about quoting apply. When headers are read from a\n              file, Empty lines and lines starting with '#' are comments\n              and ignored; each header can be folded by splitting\n              between two words and starting the continuation line with\n              a space; embedded carriage-returns and trailing spaces are\n              stripped.  Here is an example of a header file contents:\n\n                # This file contain two headers.\n                X-header-1: this is a header\n\n                # The following header is folded.\n                X-header-2: this is\n                 another header\n\n              To support sending multipart mail messages, the syntax is\n              extended as follows:\n\n              - name can be omitted: the equal sign is the first\n              character of the argument,\n\n              - if data starts with '(', this signals to start a new\n              multipart: it can be followed by a content type\n              specification.\n\n              - a multipart can be terminated with a '=)' argument.\n\n              Example: the following command sends an SMTP mime email\n              consisting in an inline part in two alternative formats:\n              plain text and HTML. It attaches a text file:\n\n               curl -F '=(;type=multipart/alternative' \\\n                    -F '=plain text message' \\\n                    -F '= <body>HTML message</body>;type=text/html' \\\n                    -F '=)' -F '=@textfile.txt' ...  smtp://example.com\n\n              Data can be encoded for transfer using encoder=. Available\n              encodings arebinaryand8bitthat do nothing else than\n              adding the corresponding Content-Transfer-Encoding header,7bitthat only rejects 8-bit characters with a transfer\n              error,quoted-printableandbase64that encodes data\n              according to the corresponding schemes, limiting lines\n              length to 76 characters.\n\n              Example: send multipart mail with a quoted-printable text\n              message and a base64 attached file:\n\n               curl -F '=text message;encoder=quoted-printable' \\\n                    -F '=@localfile;encoder=base64' ... smtp://example.com\n\n              See further examples and details in the MANUAL.-F, --formcan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Example:\n               curl --form \"name=curl\" --form \"file=@loadthis\"https://example.comSee also-d, --data,--form-stringand--form-escape. This\n              option is mutually exclusive to-d, --dataand-I, --headand-T, --upload-file.\n\n       --form-escape\n              (HTTP) Tells curl to pass on names of multipart form\n              fields and files using backslash-escaping instead of\n              percent-encoding.\n\n              If--form-escapeis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --form-escape -F 'field\\name=curl' -F 'file=@load\"this'https://example.comSee also-F, --form. Added in 7.81.0.\n\n       --form-string <name=string>\n              (HTTP SMTP IMAP) Similar to-F, --formexcept that the\n              value string for the named parameter is used literally.\n              Leading '@' and '<' characters, and the ';type=' string in\n              the value have no special meaning. Use this in preference\n              to-F, --formif there is any possibility that the string\n              value may accidentally trigger the '@' or '<' features of-F, --form.--form-stringcan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Example:\n               curl --form-string \"data\"https://example.comSee also-F, --form.\n\n       --ftp-account <data>\n              (FTP) When an FTP server asks for \"account data\" after\n              user name and password has been provided, this data is\n              sent off using the ACCT command.\n\n              If--ftp-accountis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --ftp-account \"mr.robot\" ftp://example.com/\n\n              See also-u, --user.\n\n       --ftp-alternative-to-user <command>\n              (FTP) If authenticating with the USER and PASS commands\n              fails, send this command.  When connecting to Tumbleweed's\n              Secure Transport server over FTPS using a client\n              certificate, using \"SITE AUTH\" tells the server to\n              retrieve the username from the certificate.\n\n              If--ftp-alternative-to-useris provided several times,\n              the last set value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --ftp-alternative-to-user \"U53r\" ftp://example.com\n\n              See also--ftp-accountand-u, --user.\n\n       --ftp-create-dirs\n              (FTP SFTP) When an FTP or SFTP URL/operation uses a path\n              that does not currently exist on the server, the standard\n              behavior of curl is to fail. Using this option, curl\n              instead attempts to create missing directories.\n\n              Providing--ftp-create-dirsmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --no-ftp-create-dirs.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --ftp-create-dirs -T file ftp://example.com/remote/path/file\n\n              See also--create-dirs.\n\n       --ftp-method <method>\n              (FTP) Control what method curl should use to reach a file\n              on an FTP(S) server. The method argument should be one of\n              the following alternatives:\n\n              multicwd\n                     curl does a single CWD operation for each path part\n                     in the given URL. For deep hierarchies this means\n                     many commands. This is how RFC 1738 says it should\n                     be done. This is the default but the slowest\n                     behavior.\n\n              nocwd  curl does no CWD at all. curl does SIZE, RETR, STOR\n                     etc and give a full path to the server for all\n                     these commands. This is the fastest behavior.\n\n              singlecwd\n                     curl does one CWD with the full target directory\n                     and then operates on the file \"normally\" (like in\n                     the multicwd case). This is somewhat more standards\n                     compliant than 'nocwd' but without the full penalty\n                     of 'multicwd'.\n\n              If--ftp-methodis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Examples:\n               curl --ftp-method multicwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file\n               curl --ftp-method nocwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file\n               curl --ftp-method singlecwd ftp://example.com/dir1/dir2/file\n\n              See also-l, --list-only.\n\n       --ftp-pasv\n              (FTP) Use passive mode for the data connection. Passive is\n              the internal default behavior, but using this option can\n              be used to override a previous-P, --ftp-portoption.\n\n              Reversing an enforced passive really is not doable but you\n              must then instead enforce the correct-P, --ftp-portagain.\n\n              Passive mode means that curl tries the EPSV command first\n              and then PASV, unless--disable-epsvis used.\n\n              Providing--ftp-pasvmultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --no-ftp-pasv.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --ftp-pasv ftp://example.com/\n\n              See also--disable-epsv.\n\n       -P, --ftp-port <address>\n              (FTP) Reverses the default initiator/listener roles when\n              connecting with FTP. This option makes curl use active\n              mode. curl then tells the server to connect back to the\n              client's specified address and port, while passive mode\n              asks the server to setup an IP address and port for it to\n              connect to. <address> should be one of:\n\n              interface\n                     e.g. \"eth0\" to specify which interface's IP address\n                     you want to use (Unix only)\n\n              IP address\n                     e.g. \"192.168.10.1\" to specify the exact IP address\n\n              host name\n                     e.g. \"my.host.domain\" to specify the machine\n\n              -      make curl pick the same IP address that is already\n                     used for the control connection\n\n              Disable the use of PORT with--ftp-pasv. Disable the\n              attempt to use the EPRT command instead of PORT by using--disable-eprt. EPRT is really PORT++.\n\n              You can also append \":[start]-[end]\" to the right of the\n              address, to tell curl what TCP port range to use. That\n              means you specify a port range, from a lower to a higher\n              number. A single number works as well, but do note that it\n              increases the risk of failure since the port may not be\n              available.\n\n              If-P, --ftp-portis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Examples:\n               curl -P - ftp:/example.com\n               curl -P eth0 ftp:/example.com\n               curl -P 192.168.0.2 ftp:/example.com\n\n              See also--ftp-pasvand--disable-eprt.\n\n       --ftp-pret\n              (FTP) Tell curl to send a PRET command before PASV (and\n              EPSV). Certain FTP servers, mainly drftpd, require this\n              non-standard command for directory listings as well as up\n              and downloads in PASV mode.\n\n              Providing--ftp-pretmultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --no-ftp-pret.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --ftp-pret ftp://example.com/\n\n              See also-P, --ftp-portand--ftp-pasv.\n\n       --ftp-skip-pasv-ip\n              (FTP) Tell curl to not use the IP address the server\n              suggests in its response to curl's PASV command when curl\n              connects the data connection. Instead curl reuses the same\n              IP address it already uses for the control connection.\n\n              This option is enabled by default (added in 7.74.0).\n\n              This option has no effect if PORT, EPRT or EPSV is used\n              instead of PASV.\n\n              Providing--ftp-skip-pasv-ipmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.

Allows secure authentication, but non-encrypted\n              data transfers for efficiency.  Fails the transfer if the\n              server does not support SSL/TLS.\n\n              Providing--ftp-ssl-controlmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.

When used on an FTP or FILE\n              file, curl displays the file size and last modification\n              time only.\n\n              Providing-I, --headmultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --no-head.\n\n              Example:\n               curl -Ihttps://example.comSee also-G, --get,-v, --verboseand--trace-ascii.\n\n       -H, --header <header/@file>\n              (HTTP IMAP SMTP) Extra header to include in information\n              sent. When used within an HTTP request, it is added to the\n              regular request headers.\n\n              For an IMAP or SMTP MIME uploaded mail built with-F,--formoptions, it is prepended to the resulting MIME\n              document, effectively including it at the mail global\n              level. It does not affect raw uploaded mails (Added in\n              7.56.0).\n\n              You may specify any number of extra headers. Note that if\n              you should add a custom header that has the same name as\n              one of the internal ones curl would use, your externally\n              set header is used instead of the internal one. This\n              allows you to make even trickier stuff than curl would\n              normally do. You should not replace internally set headers\n              without knowing perfectly well what you are doing. Remove\n              an internal header by giving a replacement without content\n              on the right side of the colon, as in: -H \"Host:\". If you\n              send the custom header with no-value then its header must\n              be terminated with a semicolon, such as -H\n              \"X-Custom-Header;\" to send \"X-Custom-Header:\".\n\n              curl makes sure that each header you add/replace is sent\n              with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thusnotadd that as a part of the header content: do not add\n              newlines or carriage returns, they only mess things up for\n              you. curl passes on the verbatim string you give it\n              without any filter or other safe guards. That includes\n              white space and control characters.\n\n              This option can take an argument in @filename style, which\n              then adds a header for each line in the input file. Using\n              @- makes curl read the header file from stdin. Added in\n              7.55.0.\n\n              Please note that most anti-spam utilities check the\n              presence and value of several MIME mail headers: these are\n              \"From:\", \"To:\", \"Date:\" and \"Subject:\" among others and\n              should be added with this option.\n\n              You need--proxy-headerto send custom headers intended\n              for an HTTP proxy.

This option makes curl skip the verification step\n              and proceed without checking.\n\n              When this option is not used for protocols using TLS, curl\n              verifies the server's TLS certificate before it continues:\n              that the certificate contains the right name which matches\n              the host name used in the URL and that the certificate has\n              been signed by a CA certificate present in the cert store.\n              See this online resource for further details:https://curl.se/docs/sslcerts.htmlFor SFTP and SCP, this option makes curl skip theknown_hostsverification.known_hostsis a file normally\n              stored in the user's home directory in the \".ssh\"\n              subdirectory, which contains host names and their public\n              keys.WARNING: using this option makes the transfer insecure.\n\n              When curl uses secure protocols it trusts responses and\n              allows for example HSTS and Alt-Svc information to be\n              stored and used subsequently. Using-k, --insecurecan\n              make curl trust and use such information from malicious\n              servers.\n\n              Providing-k, --insecuremultiple times has no extra\n              effect.

Not specifying this will instead make curl check if\n              the IPFS_GATEWAY environment variable is set, or if a\n              ~/.ipfs/gateway file holding the gateway URL exists.\n\n              If you run a local IPFS node, this gateway is by default\n              available underhttp://localhost:8080. A full example URL\n              would look like:\n\n               curl --ipfs-gatewayhttp://localhost:8080ipfs://bafybeigagd5nmnn2iys2f3doro7ydrevyr2mzarwidgadawmamiteydbzi\n\n              There are many public IPFS gateways. See for example:https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/WARNING: If you opt to go for a remote gateway you should\n              be aware that you completely trust the gateway. This is\n              fine in local gateways as you host it yourself. With\n              remote gateways there could potentially be a malicious\n              actor returning you data that does not match the request\n              you made, inspect or even interfere with the request. You\n              will not notice this when using curl. A mitigation could\n              be to go for a \"trustless\" gateway. This means you locally\n              verify that the data. Consult the docs page on trusted vs\n              trustless:https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/#trusted-vs-trustlessIf--ipfs-gatewayis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --ipfs-gatewayhttps://example.comipfs://\n\n              See also-h, --helpand-M, --manual.

Posting data\n              from a file named 'foobar' would thus be done with--json@foobar and to instead read the data from stdin, use--json@-.\n\n              If this option is used more than once on the same command\n              line, the additional data pieces are concatenated to the\n              previous before sending.\n\n              The headers this option sets can be overridden with-H,--headeras usual.--jsoncan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Examples:\n               curl --json '{ \"drink\": \"coffe\" }'https://example.comcurl --json '{ \"drink\":' --json ' \"coffe\" }'https://example.comcurl --json @preparedhttps://example.comcurl --json @-https://example.com< json.txt\n\n              See also--data-binaryand--data-raw.

Added in 7.82.0.\n\n       -j, --junk-session-cookies\n              (HTTP) When curl is told to read cookies from a given\n              file, this option makes it discard all \"session cookies\".\n              This has the same effect as if a new session is started.\n              Typical browsers discard session cookies when they are\n              closed down.\n\n              Providing-j, --junk-session-cookiesmultiple times has no\n              extra effect.  Disable it again with\n              --no-junk-session-cookies.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --junk-session-cookies -b cookies.txthttps://example.comSee also-b, --cookieand-c, --cookie-jar.\n\n       --keepalive-time <seconds>\n              This option sets the time a connection needs to remain\n              idle before sending keepalive probes and the time between\n              individual keepalive probes. It is currently effective on\n              operating systems offering the TCP_KEEPIDLE and\n              TCP_KEEPINTVL socket options (meaning Linux, recent AIX,\n              HP-UX and more).  Keepalives are used by the TCP stack to\n              detect broken networks on idle connections. The number of\n              missed keepalive probes before declaring the connection\n              down is OS dependent and is commonly 9 or 10. This option\n              has no effect if--no-keepaliveis used.\n\n              If unspecified, the option defaults to 60 seconds.\n\n              If--keepalive-timeis provided several times, the last\n              set value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --keepalive-time 20https://example.comSee also--no-keepaliveand-m, --max-time.\n\n       --key <key>\n              (TLS SSH) Private key file name. Allows you to provide\n              your private key in this separate file. For SSH, if not\n              specified, curl tries the following candidates in order:\n              '~/.ssh/id_rsa', '~/.ssh/id_dsa', './id_rsa', './id_dsa'.\n\n              If curl is built against OpenSSL library, and the engine\n              pkcs11 is available, then a PKCS#11 URI (RFC 7512) can be\n              used to specify a private key located in a PKCS#11 device.\n              A string beginning with \"pkcs11:\" is interpreted as a\n              PKCS#11 URI. If a PKCS#11 URI is provided, then the--engineoption is set as \"pkcs11\" if none was provided\n              and the--key-typeoption is set as \"ENG\" if none was\n              provided.\n\n              If curl is built against Secure Transport or Schannel then\n              this option is ignored for TLS protocols (HTTPS, etc).\n              Those backends expect the private key to be already\n              present in the keychain or PKCS#12 file containing the\n              certificate.\n\n              If--keyis provided several times, the last set value is\n              used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --cert certificate --key herehttps://example.comSee also--key-typeand-E, --cert.\n\n       --key-type <type>\n              (TLS) Private key file type. Specify which type your--keyprovided private key is. DER, PEM, and ENG are supported.\n              If not specified, PEM is assumed.\n\n              If--key-typeis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --key-type DER --key herehttps://example.comSee also--key.\n\n       --krb <level>\n              (FTP) Enable Kerberos authentication and use. The level\n              must be entered and should be one of 'clear', 'safe',\n              'confidential', or 'private'. Should you use a level that\n              is not one of these, 'private' is used.\n\n              If--krbis provided several times, the last set value is\n              used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --krb clear ftp://example.com/\n\n              See also--delegationand--ssl.--krbrequires that the\n              underlying libcurl was built to support Kerberos.\n\n       --libcurl <file>\n              Append this option to any ordinary curl command line, and\n              you get libcurl-using C source code written to the file\n              that does the equivalent of what your command-line\n              operation does!\n\n              This option is global and does not need to be specified\n              for each use of --next.\n\n              If--libcurlis provided several times, the last set value\n              is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --libcurl client.chttps://example.comSee also-v, --verbose.\n\n       --limit-rate <speed>\n              Specify the maximum transfer rate you want curl to use -\n              for both downloads and uploads. This feature is useful if\n              you have a limited pipe and you would like your transfer\n              not to use your entire bandwidth. To make it slower than\n              it otherwise would be.\n\n              The given speed is measured in bytes/second, unless a\n              suffix is appended.  Appending 'k' or 'K' counts the\n              number as kilobytes, 'm' or 'M' makes it megabytes, while\n              'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. The suffixes (k, M, G, T,\n              P) are 1024 based. For example 1k is 1024. Examples: 200K,\n              3m and 1G.\n\n              The rate limiting logic works on averaging the transfer\n              speed to no more than the set threshold over a period of\n              multiple seconds.\n\n              If you also use the-Y, --speed-limitoption, that option\n              takes precedence and might cripple the rate-limiting\n              slightly, to help keeping the speed-limit logic working.\n\n              If--limit-rateis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Examples:\n               curl --limit-rate 100Khttps://example.comcurl --limit-rate 1000https://example.comcurl --limit-rate 10Mhttps://example.comSee also--rate,-Y, --speed-limitand-y, --speed-time.\n\n       -l, --list-only\n              (FTP POP3 SFTP) (FTP) When listing an FTP directory, this\n              switch forces a name-only view. This is especially useful\n              if the user wants to machine-parse the contents of an FTP\n              directory since the normal directory view does not use a\n              standard look or format. When used like this, the option\n              causes an NLST command to be sent to the server instead of\n              LIST.\n\n              Note: Some FTP servers list only files in their response\n              to NLST; they do not include sub-directories and symbolic\n              links.\n\n              (SFTP) When listing an SFTP directory, this switch forces\n              a name-only view, one per line.  This is especially useful\n              if the user wants to machine-parse the contents of an SFTP\n              directory since the normal directory view provides more\n              information than just file names.\n\n              (POP3) When retrieving a specific email from POP3, this\n              switch forces a LIST command to be performed instead of\n              RETR. This is particularly useful if the user wants to see\n              if a specific message-id exists on the server and what\n              size it is.\n\n              Note: When combined with-X, --request, this option can be\n              used to send a UIDL command instead, so the user may use\n              the email's unique identifier rather than its message-id\n              to make the request.\n\n              Providing-l, --list-onlymultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --no-list-only.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --list-only ftp://example.com/dir/\n\n              See also-Q, --quoteand-X, --request.\n\n       --local-port <num/range>\n              Set a preferred single number or range (FROM-TO) of local\n              port numbers to use for the connection(s).  Note that port\n              numbers by nature are a scarce resource so setting this\n              range to something too narrow might cause unnecessary\n              connection setup failures.\n\n              If--local-portis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --local-port 1000-3000https://example.comSee also-g, --globoff.\n\n       -L, --location\n              (HTTP) If the server reports that the requested page has\n              moved to a different location (indicated with a Location:\n              header and a 3XX response code), this option makes curl\n              redo the request on the new place. If used together with-i, --includeor-I, --head, headers from all requested\n              pages are shown.\n\n              When authentication is used, curl only sends its\n              credentials to the initial host. If a redirect takes curl\n              to a different host, it does not get the user+password\n              pass on. See also--location-trustedon how to change\n              this.\n\n              Limit the amount of redirects to follow by using the--max-redirsoption.\n\n              When curl follows a redirect and if the request is a POST,\n              it sends the following request with a GET if the HTTP\n              response was 301, 302, or 303. If the response code was\n              any other 3xx code, curl resends the following request\n              using the same unmodified method.\n\n              You can tell curl to not change POST requests to GET after\n              a 30x response by using the dedicated options for that:--post301,--post302and--post303.\n\n              The method set with-X, --requestoverrides the method\n              curl would otherwise select to use.\n\n              Providing-L, --locationmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --no-location.\n\n              Example:\n               curl -Lhttps://example.comSee also--resolveand--alt-svc.\n\n       --location-trusted\n              (HTTP) Like-L, --location, but allows sending the name +\n              password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This\n              may or may not introduce a security breach if the site\n              redirects you to a site to which you send your\n              authentication info (which is plaintext in the case of\n              HTTP Basic authentication).\n\n              Providing--location-trustedmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.

At present\n              only IMAP, POP3 and SMTP support login options. For more\n              information about login options please see RFC 2384, RFC\n              5092 and the IETF drafthttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-earhart-url-smtp-00.\n\n              Since 8.2.0, IMAP supports the login option \"AUTH=+LOGIN\".\n              With this option, curl uses the plain (not SASL) LOGIN\n              IMAP command even if the server advertises SASL\n              authentication. Care should be taken in using this option,\n              as it sends your password over the network in plain text.\n              This does not work if the IMAP server disables the plain\n              LOGIN (e.g. to prevent password snooping).\n\n              If--login-optionsis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --login-options 'AUTH=*' imap://example.com\n\n              See also-u, --user.\n\n       --mail-auth <address>\n              (SMTP) Specify a single address. This is used to specify\n              the authentication address (identity) of a submitted\n              message that is being relayed to another server.\n\n              If--mail-authis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --mail-auth user@example.come -T mail smtp://example.com/\n\n              See also--mail-rcptand--mail-from.\n\n       --mail-from <address>\n              (SMTP) Specify a single address that the given mail should\n              get sent from.\n\n              If--mail-fromis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --mail-from user@example.com -T mail smtp://example.com/\n\n              See also--mail-rcptand--mail-auth.\n\n       --mail-rcpt <address>\n              (SMTP) Specify a single email address, user name or\n              mailing list name. Repeat this option several times to\n              send to multiple recipients.\n\n              When performing an address verification (VRFYcommand),\n              the recipient should be specified as the user name or user\n              name and domain (as per Section 3.5 of RFC 5321).\n\n              When performing a mailing list expand (EXPN command), the\n              recipient should be specified using the mailing list name,\n              such as \"Friends\" or \"London-Office\".--mail-rcptcan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Example:\n               curl --mail-rcpt user@example.net smtp://example.com\n\n              See also--mail-rcpt-allowfails.\n\n       --mail-rcpt-allowfails\n              (SMTP) When sending data to multiple recipients, by\n              default curl aborts SMTP conversation if at least one of\n              the recipients causes RCPT TO command to return an error.\n\n              The default behavior can be changed by passing--mail-rcpt-allowfailscommand-line option which makes\n              curl ignore errors and proceed with the remaining valid\n              recipients.\n\n              If all recipients trigger RCPT TO failures and this flag\n              is specified, curl still aborts the SMTP conversation and\n              returns the error received from to the last RCPT TO\n              command.\n\n              Providing--mail-rcpt-allowfailsmultiple times has no\n              extra effect.  Disable it again with\n              --no-mail-rcpt-allowfails.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --mail-rcpt-allowfails --mail-rcpt dest@example.com smtp://example.com\n\n              See also--mail-rcpt. Added in 7.69.0.\n\n       -M, --manual\n              Manual. Display the huge help text.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --manual\n\n              See also-v, --verbose,--libcurland--trace.\n\n       --max-filesize <bytes>\n              (FTP HTTP MQTT) Specify the maximum size (in bytes) of a\n              file to download. If the file requested is larger than\n              this value, the transfer does not start and curl returns\n              with exit code 63.\n\n              A size modifier may be used. For example, Appending 'k' or\n              'K' counts the number as kilobytes, 'm' or 'M' makes it\n              megabytes, while 'g' or 'G' makes it gigabytes. Examples:\n              200K, 3m and 1G. (Added in 7.58.0)NOTE: before curl 8.4.0, when the file size is not known\n              prior to download, for such files this option has no\n              effect even if the file transfer ends up being larger than\n              this given limit.\n\n              Starting with curl 8.4.0, this option aborts the transfer\n              if it reaches the threshold during transfer.\n\n              If--max-filesizeis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --max-filesize 100Khttps://example.comSee also--limit-rate.\n\n       --max-redirs <num>\n              (HTTP) Set maximum number of redirections to follow. When-L, --locationis used, to prevent curl from following too\n              many redirects, by default, the limit is set to 50\n              redirects. Set this option to -1 to make it unlimited.\n\n              If--max-redirsis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --max-redirs 3 --locationhttps://example.comSee also-L, --location.\n\n       -m, --max-time <fractional seconds>\n              Maximum time in seconds that you allow each transfer to\n              take.  This is useful for preventing your batch jobs from\n              hanging for hours due to slow networks or links going\n              down. This option accepts decimal values.\n\n              If you enable retrying the transfer (--retry) then the\n              maximum time counter is reset each time the transfer is\n              retried. You can use--retry-max-timeto limit the retry\n              time.\n\n              The decimal value needs to provided using a dot (.) as\n              decimal separator - not the local version even if it might\n              be using another separator.\n\n              If-m, --max-timeis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Examples:\n               curl --max-time 10https://example.comcurl --max-time 2.92https://example.comSee also--connect-timeoutand--retry-max-time.\n\n       --metalink\n              This option was previously used to specify a Metalink\n              resource. Metalink support is disabled in curl for\n              security reasons (added in 7.78.0).\n\n              If--metalinkis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --metalink filehttps://example.comSee also-Z, --parallel.\n\n       --negotiate\n              (HTTP) Enables Negotiate (SPNEGO) authentication.\n\n              This option requires a library built with GSS-API or SSPI\n              support. Use-V, --versionto see if your curl supports\n              GSS-API/SSPI or SPNEGO.\n\n              When using this option, you must also provide a fake-u,--useroption to activate the authentication code\n              properly. Sending a '-u :' is enough as the user name and\n              password from the-u, --useroption are not actually used.\n\n              Providing--negotiatemultiple times has no extra effect.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --negotiate -u :https://example.comSee also--basic,--ntlm,--anyauthand--proxy-negotiate.\n\n       -n, --netrc\n              Makes curl scan the.netrcfile in the user's home\n              directory for login name and password. This is typically\n              used for FTP on Unix. If used with HTTP, curl enables user\n              authentication. Seenetrc(5) andftp(1) for details on the\n              file format. Curl does not complain if that file does not\n              have the right permissions (it should be neither world-\n              nor group-readable). The environment variable \"HOME\" is\n              used to find the home directory.\n\n              On Windows two filenames in the home directory are\n              checked:.netrcand_netrc, preferring the former. Older\n              versions on Windows checked for_netrconly.\n\n              A quick and simple example of how to setup a.netrcto\n              allow curl to FTP to the machine host.domain.com with user\n              name 'myself' and password 'secret' could look similar to:\n\n               machine host.domain.com\n               login myself\n               password secret\n\n              Providing-n, --netrcmultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --no-netrc.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --netrchttps://example.comSee also--netrc-file,-K, --configand-u, --user. This\n              option is mutually exclusive to--netrc-fileand--netrc-optional.\n\n       --netrc-file <filename>\n              This option is similar to-n, --netrc, except that you\n              provide the path (absolute or relative) to the netrc file\n              that curl should use. You can only specify one netrc file\n              per invocation.\n\n              It abides by--netrc-optionalif specified.\n\n              If--netrc-fileis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --netrc-file netrchttps://example.comSee also-n, --netrc,-u, --userand-K, --config. This\n              option is mutually exclusive to-n, --netrc.\n\n       --netrc-optional\n              Similar to-n, --netrc, but this option makes the .netrc\n              usageoptionaland not mandatory as the-n, --netrcoption\n              does.\n\n              Providing--netrc-optionalmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --no-netrc-optional.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --netrc-optionalhttps://example.comSee also--netrc-file. This option is mutually exclusive\n              to-n, --netrc.\n\n       -:, --next\n              Tells curl to use a separate operation for the following\n              URL and associated options. This allows you to send\n              several URL requests, each with their own specific\n              options, for example, such as different user names or\n              custom requests for each.-:, --nextresets all local options and only global ones\n              have their values survive over to the operation following\n              the-:, --nextinstruction. Global options include-v,--verbose,--trace,--trace-asciiand--fail-early.\n\n              For example, you can do both a GET and a POST in a single\n              command line:\n\n               curl www1.example.com --next -d postthis www2.example.com-:, --nextcan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Examples:\n               curlhttps://example.com--next -d postthis www2.example.com\n               curl -Ihttps://example.com--nexthttps://example.net/See also-Z, --paralleland-K, --config.\n\n       --no-alpn\n              (HTTPS) Disable the ALPN TLS extension. ALPN is enabled by\n              default if libcurl was built with an SSL library that\n              supports ALPN. ALPN is used by a libcurl that supports\n              HTTP/2 to negotiate HTTP/2 support with the server during\n              https sessions.\n\n              Note that this is the negated option name documented. You\n              can use --alpn to enable ALPN.\n\n              Providing--no-alpnmultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --alpn.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --no-alpnhttps://example.comSee also--no-npnand--http2.--no-alpnrequires that the\n              underlying libcurl was built to support TLS.\n\n       -N, --no-buffer\n              Disables the buffering of the output stream. In normal\n              work situations, curl uses a standard buffered output\n              stream that has the effect that it outputs the data in\n              chunks, not necessarily exactly when the data arrives.\n              Using this option disables that buffering.\n\n              Note that this is the negated option name documented. You\n              can use --buffer to enable buffering again.\n\n              Providing-N, --no-buffermultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --buffer.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --no-bufferhttps://example.comSee also-#, --progress-bar.\n\n       --no-clobber\n              When used in conjunction with the-o, --output,-J,--remote-header-name,-O, --remote-name, or--remote-name-alloptions, curl avoids overwriting files\n              that already exist. Instead, a dot and a number gets\n              appended to the name of the file that would be created, up\n              to filename.100 after which it does not create any file.\n\n              Note that this is the negated option name documented.  You\n              can thus use --clobber to enforce the clobbering, even if-J, --remote-header-nameis specified.\n\n              Providing--no-clobbermultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --clobber.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --no-clobber --output local/dir/filehttps://example.comSee also-o, --outputand-O, --remote-name. Added in\n              7.83.0.\n\n       --no-keepalive\n              Disables the use of keepalive messages on the TCP\n              connection. curl otherwise enables them by default.\n\n              Note that this is the negated option name documented. You\n              can thus use --keepalive to enforce keepalive.\n\n              Providing--no-keepalivemultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --keepalive.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --no-keepalivehttps://example.comSee also--keepalive-time.\n\n       --no-npn\n              (HTTPS) curl never uses NPN, this option has no effect\n              (added in 7.86.0).\n\n              Disable the NPN TLS extension. NPN is enabled by default\n              if libcurl was built with an SSL library that supports\n              NPN. NPN is used by a libcurl that supports HTTP/2 to\n              negotiate HTTP/2 support with the server during https\n              sessions.\n\n              Providing--no-npnmultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --npn.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --no-npnhttps://example.comSee also--no-alpnand--http2.--no-npnrequires that the\n              underlying libcurl was built to support TLS.\n\n       --no-progress-meter\n              Option to switch off the progress meter output without\n              muting or otherwise affecting warning and informational\n              messages like-s, --silentdoes.\n\n              Note that this is the negated option name documented. You\n              can thus use --progress-meter to enable the progress meter\n              again.\n\n              Providing--no-progress-metermultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --progress-meter.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --no-progress-meter -o storehttps://example.comSee also-v, --verboseand-s, --silent. Added in 7.67.0.\n\n       --no-sessionid\n              (TLS) Disable curl's use of SSL session-ID caching. By\n              default all transfers are done using the cache. Note that\n              while nothing should ever get hurt by attempting to reuse\n              SSL session-IDs, there seem to be broken SSL\n              implementations in the wild that may require you to\n              disable this in order for you to succeed.\n\n              Note that this is the negated option name documented. You\n              can thus use --sessionid to enforce session-ID caching.\n\n              Providing--no-sessionidmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --sessionid.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --no-sessionidhttps://example.comSee also-k, --insecure.\n\n       --noproxy <no-proxy-list>\n              Comma-separated list of hosts for which not to use a\n              proxy, if one is specified. The only wildcard is a single\n              * character, which matches all hosts, and effectively\n              disables the proxy. Each name in this list is matched as\n              either a domain which contains the hostname, or the\n              hostname itself. For example, local.com would match\n              local.com, local.com:80, and www.local.com, but not\n              www.notlocal.com.\n\n              This option overrides the environment variables that\n              disable the proxy ('no_proxy' and 'NO_PROXY') (added in\n              7.53.0). If there is an environment variable disabling a\n              proxy, you can set the no proxy list to \"\" to override it.\n\n              IP addresses specified to this option can be provided\n              using CIDR notation (added in 7.86.0): an appended slash\n              and number specifies the number of \"network bits\" out of\n              the address to use in the comparison. For example\n              \"192.168.0.0/16\" would match all addresses starting with\n              \"192.168\".\n\n              If--noproxyis provided several times, the last set value\n              is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --noproxy \"www.example\"https://example.comSee also-x, --proxy.\n\n       --ntlm (HTTP) Enables NTLM authentication. The NTLM\n              authentication method was designed by Microsoft and is\n              used by IIS web servers. It is a proprietary protocol,\n              reverse-engineered by clever people and implemented in\n              curl based on their efforts. This kind of behavior should\n              not be endorsed, you should encourage everyone who uses\n              NTLM to switch to a public and documented authentication\n              method instead, such as Digest.\n\n              If you want to enable NTLM for your proxy authentication,\n              then use--proxy-ntlm.\n\n              Providing--ntlmmultiple times has no extra effect.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --ntlm -u user:passwordhttps://example.comSee also--proxy-ntlm.--ntlmrequires that the underlying\n              libcurl was built to support TLS.

The Bearer Token is used\n              in conjunction with the user name which can be specified\n              as part of the--urlor-u, --useroptions.\n\n              The Bearer Token and user name are formatted according to\n              RFC 6750.\n\n              If--oauth2-beareris provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --oauth2-bearer \"mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM\"https://example.comSee also--basic,--ntlmand--digest.\n\n       -o, --output <file>\n              Write output to <file> instead of stdout. If you are using\n              {} or [] to fetch multiple documents, you should quote the\n              URL and you can use '#' followed by a number in the <file>\n              specifier. That variable is replaced with the current\n              string for the URL being fetched. Like in:\n\n               curl \"http://{one,two}.example.com\" -o \"file_#1.txt\"\n\n              or use several variables like:\n\n               curl \"http://{site,host}.host[1-5].example\" -o \"#1_#2\"\n\n              You may use this option as many times as the number of\n              URLs you have. For example, if you specify two URLs on the\n              same command line, you can use it like this:\n\n               curl -o aa example.com -o bb example.net\n\n              and the order of the -o options and the URLs does not\n              matter, just that the first -o is for the first URL and so\n              on, so the above command line can also be written as\n\n               curl example.com example.net -o aa -o bb\n\n              See also the--create-dirsoption to create the local\n              directories dynamically. Specifying the output as '-' (a\n              single dash) passes the output to stdout.\n\n              To suppress response bodies, you can redirect output to\n              /dev/null:\n\n               curl example.com -o /dev/null\n\n              Or for Windows:\n\n               curl example.com -o nul-o, --outputcan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Examples:\n               curl -o filehttps://example.comcurl \"http://{one,two}.example.com\" -o \"file_#1.txt\"\n               curl \"http://{site,host}.host[1-5].example\" -o \"#1_#2\"\n               curl -o filehttps://example.com-o file2https://example.netSee also-O, --remote-name,--remote-name-alland-J,--remote-header-name.\n\n       --output-dir <dir>\n              This option specifies the directory in which files should\n              be stored, when-O, --remote-nameor-o, --outputare\n              used.\n\n              The given output directory is used for all URLs and output\n              options on the command line, up until the first-:,--next.\n\n              If the specified target directory does not exist, the\n              operation fails unless--create-dirsis also used.\n\n              If--output-diris provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --output-dir \"tmp\" -Ohttps://example.comSee also-O, --remote-nameand-J, --remote-header-name.\n              Added in 7.73.0.\n\n       -Z, --parallel\n              Makes curl perform its transfers in parallel as compared\n              to the regular serial manner.\n\n              This option is global and does not need to be specified\n              for each use of --next.\n\n              Providing-Z, --parallelmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.

In such a case curl first connects\n              to the SOCKS proxy and then connects (through SOCKS) to\n              the HTTP or HTTPS proxy. Hence pre proxy.\n\n              The pre proxy string should be specified with a\n              protocol:// prefix to specify alternative proxy protocols.\n              Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or socks5h:// to\n              request the specific SOCKS version to be used. No protocol\n              specified makes curl default to SOCKS4.\n\n              If the port number is not specified in the proxy string,\n              it is assumed to be 1080.\n\n              User and password that might be provided in the proxy\n              string are URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in\n              special characters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a\n              colon with %3a.\n\n              If--preproxyis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --preproxy socks5://proxy.example -xhttp://http.examplehttps://example.comSee also-x, --proxyand--socks5.

Use socks4://, socks4a://, socks5:// or\n              socks5h:// to request a specific SOCKS version to be used.\n\n              Unix domain sockets are supported for socks proxy. Set\n              localhost for the host part. e.g.\n              socks5h://localhost/path/to/socket.sock\n\n              HTTPS proxy support works set with thehttps://protocol\n              prefix for OpenSSL and GnuTLS (added in 7.52.0). It also\n              works for BearSSL, mbedTLS, rustls, Schannel, Secure\n              Transport and wolfSSL (added in 7.87.0).\n\n              Unrecognized and unsupported proxy protocols cause an\n              error (added in 7.52.0).  Ancient curl versions ignored\n              unknown schemes and usedhttp://instead.\n\n              If the port number is not specified in the proxy string,\n              it is assumed to be 1080.\n\n              This option overrides existing environment variables that\n              set the proxy to use. If there is an environment variable\n              setting a proxy, you can set proxy to \"\" to override it.\n\n              All operations that are performed over an HTTP proxy are\n              transparently converted to HTTP. It means that certain\n              protocol specific operations might not be available. This\n              is not the case if you can tunnel through the proxy, as\n              one with the-p, --proxytunneloption.\n\n              User and password that might be provided in the proxy\n              string are URL decoded by curl. This allows you to pass in\n              special characters such as @ by using %40 or pass in a\n              colon with %3a.\n\n              The proxy host can be specified the same way as the proxy\n              environment variables, including the protocol prefix\n              (http://) and the embedded user + password.\n\n              When a proxy is used, the active FTP mode as set with-P,--ftp-port, cannot be used.\n\n              If-x, --proxyis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --proxyhttp://proxy.examplehttps://example.comSee also--socks5and--proxy-basic.\n\n       --proxy-anyauth\n              Tells curl to pick a suitable authentication method when\n              communicating with the given HTTP proxy. This might cause\n              an extra request/response round-trip.\n\n              Providing--proxy-anyauthmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --proxy-anyauth --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxyhttps://example.comSee also-x, --proxy,--proxy-basicand--proxy-digest.\n\n       --proxy-basic\n              Tells curl to use HTTP Basic authentication when\n              communicating with the given proxy. Use--basicfor\n              enabling HTTP Basic with a remote host. Basic is the\n              default authentication method curl uses with proxies.\n\n              Providing--proxy-basicmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --proxy-basic --proxy-user user:passwd -x proxyhttps://example.comSee also-x, --proxy,--proxy-anyauthand--proxy-digest.\n\n       --proxy-ca-native\n              (TLS) Tells curl to use the CA store from the native\n              operating system to verify the HTTPS proxy. By default,\n              curl uses a CA store provided in a single file or\n              directory, but when using this option it interfaces the\n              operating system's own vault.\n\n              This option only works for curl on Windows when built to\n              use OpenSSL. When curl on Windows is built to use\n              Schannel, this feature is implied and curl then only uses\n              the native CA store.\n\n              curl built with wolfSSL also supports this option (added\n              in 8.3.0).\n\n              Providing--proxy-ca-nativemultiple times has no extra\n              effect.

You may specify any number of extra\n              headers. This is the equivalent option to-H, --headerbut\n              is for proxy communication only like in CONNECT requests\n              when you want a separate header sent to the proxy to what\n              is sent to the actual remote host.\n\n              curl makes sure that each header you add/replace is sent\n              with the proper end-of-line marker, you should thusnotadd that as a part of the header content: do not add\n              newlines or carriage returns, they only mess things up for\n              you.\n\n              Headers specified with this option are not included in\n              requests that curl knows are not be sent to a proxy.\n\n              This option can take an argument in @filename style, which\n              then adds a header for each line in the input file (added\n              in 7.55.0). Using @- makes curl read the headers from\n              stdin.\n\n              This option can be used multiple times to\n              add/replace/remove multiple headers.--proxy-headercan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Examples:\n               curl --proxy-header \"X-First-Name: Joe\" -xhttp://proxyhttps://example.comcurl --proxy-header \"User-Agent: surprise\" -xhttp://proxyhttps://example.comcurl --proxy-header \"Host:\" -xhttp://proxyhttps://example.comSee also-x, --proxy.\n\n       --proxy-http2\n              (HTTP) Tells curl to try negotiate HTTP version 2 with an\n              HTTPS proxy. The proxy might still only offer HTTP/1 and\n              then curl sticks to using that version.\n\n              This has no effect for any other kinds of proxies.\n\n              Providing--proxy-http2multiple times has no extra\n              effect.

Added in 7.52.0.\n\n       --proxy-pinnedpubkey <hashes>\n              (TLS) Tells curl to use the specified public key file (or\n              hashes) to verify the proxy. This can be a path to a file\n              which contains a single public key in PEM or DER format,\n              or any number of base64 encoded sha256 hashes preceded by\n              'sha256//' and separated by ';'.\n\n              When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends\n              a certificate indicating its identity.

The tunnel\n              approach is made with the HTTP proxy CONNECT request and\n              requires that the proxy allows direct connect to the\n              remote port number curl wants to tunnel through to.\n\n              To suppress proxy CONNECT response headers when curl is\n              set to output headers use--suppress-connect-headers.\n\n              Providing-p, --proxytunnelmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.

Allows you to provide\n              your public key in this separate file.\n\n              curl attempts to automatically extract the public key from\n              the private key file, so passing this option is generally\n              not required. Note that this public key extraction\n              requires libcurl to be linked against a copy of libssh2\n              1.2.8 or higher that is itself linked against OpenSSL.\n\n              If--pubkeyis provided several times, the last set value\n              is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --pubkey file.pub sftp://example.com/\n\n              See also--pass.\n\n       -Q, --quote <command>\n              (FTP SFTP) Send an arbitrary command to the remote FTP or\n              SFTP server. Quote commands are sent BEFORE the transfer\n              takes place (just after the initialPWDcommand in an FTP\n              transfer, to be exact). To make commands take place after\n              a successful transfer, prefix them with a dash '-'.\n\n              (FTP only) To make commands be sent after curl has changed\n              the working directory, just before the file transfer\n              command(s), prefix the command with a '+'. This is not\n              performed when a directory listing is performed.\n\n              You may specify any number of commands.\n\n              By default curl stops at first failure. To make curl\n              continue even if the command fails, prefix the command\n              with an asterisk (*). Otherwise, if the server returns\n              failure for one of the commands, the entire operation is\n              aborted.\n\n              You must send syntactically correct FTP commands as RFC\n              959 defines to FTP servers, or one of the commands listed\n              below to SFTP servers.\n\n              SFTP is a binary protocol. Unlike for FTP, curl interprets\n              SFTP quote commands itself before sending them to the\n              server. File names may be quoted shell-style to embed\n              spaces or special characters. Following is the list of all\n              supported SFTP quote commands:\n\n              atime date file\n                     The atime command sets the last access time of the\n                     file named by the file operand. The <date\n                     expression> can be all sorts of date strings, see\n                     thecurl_getdate(3) man page for date expression\n                     details. (Added in 7.73.0)\n\n              chgrp group file\n                     The chgrp command sets the group ID of the file\n                     named by the file operand to the group ID specified\n                     by the group operand. The group operand is a\n                     decimal integer group ID.\n\n              chmod mode file\n                     The chmod command modifies the file mode bits of\n                     the specified file. The mode operand is an octal\n                     integer mode number.\n\n              chown user file\n                     The chown command sets the owner of the file named\n                     by the file operand to the user ID specified by the\n                     user operand. The user operand is a decimal integer\n                     user ID.\n\n              ln source_file target_file\n                     The ln and symlink commands create a symbolic link\n                     at the target_file location pointing to the\n                     source_file location.\n\n              mkdir directory_name\n                     The mkdir command creates the directory named by\n                     the directory_name operand.\n\n              mtime date file\n                     The mtime command sets the last modification time\n                     of the file named by the file operand. The <date\n                     expression> can be all sorts of date strings, see\n                     thecurl_getdate(3) man page for date expression\n                     details. (Added in 7.73.0)\n\n              pwd    The pwd command returns the absolute path name of\n                     the current working directory.\n\n              rename source target\n                     The rename command renames the file or directory\n                     named by the source operand to the destination path\n                     named by the target operand.\n\n              rm file\n                     The rm command removes the file specified by the\n                     file operand.\n\n              rmdir directory\n                     The rmdir command removes the directory entry\n                     specified by the directory operand, provided it is\n                     empty.\n\n              symlink source_file target_file\n                     See ln.-Q, --quotecan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Example:\n               curl --quote \"DELE file\" ftp://example.com/foo\n\n              See also-X, --request.\n\n       --random-file <file>\n              Deprecated option. This option is ignored (added in\n              7.84.0). Prior to that it only had an effect on curl if\n              built to use old versions of OpenSSL.\n\n              Specify the path name to file containing random data. The\n              data may be used to seed the random engine for SSL\n              connections.\n\n              If--random-fileis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --random-file rubbishhttps://example.comSee also--egd-file.\n\n       -r, --range <range>\n              (HTTP FTP SFTP FILE) Retrieve a byte range (i.e. a partial\n              document) from an HTTP/1.1, FTP or SFTP server or a local\n              FILE. Ranges can be specified in a number of ways.\n\n              0-499  specifies the first 500 bytes\n\n              500-999\n                     specifies the second 500 bytes\n\n              -500   specifies the last 500 bytes\n\n              9500-  specifies the bytes from offset 9500 and forward\n\n              0-0,-1 specifies the first and last byte only(*)(HTTP)\n\n              100-199,500-599\n                     specifies two separate 100-byte ranges(*) (HTTP)\n\n              (*) = NOTE that this causes the server to reply with a\n              multipart response, which is returned as-is by curl!\n              Parsing or otherwise transforming this response is the\n              responsibility of the caller.\n\n              Only digit characters (0-9) are valid in the 'start' and\n              'stop' fields of the 'start-stop' range syntax. If a\n              non-digit character is given in the range, the server's\n              response is unspecified, depending on the server's\n              configuration.\n\n              Many HTTP/1.1 servers do not have this feature enabled, so\n              that when you attempt to get a range, curl instead gets\n              the whole document.\n\n              FTP and SFTP range downloads only support the simple\n              'start-stop' syntax (optionally with one of the numbers\n              omitted). FTP use depends on the extended FTP command\n              SIZE.\n\n              If-r, --rangeis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --range 22-44https://example.comSee also-C, --continue-atand-a, --append.\n\n       --rate <max request rate>\n              Specify the maximum transfer frequency you allow curl to\n              use - in number of transfer starts per time unit\n              (sometimes called request rate). Without this option, curl\n              starts the next transfer as fast as possible.\n\n              If given several URLs and a transfer completes faster than\n              the allowed rate, curl waits until the next transfer is\n              started to maintain the requested rate. This option has no\n              effect when-Z, --parallelis used.\n\n              The request rate is provided as \"N/U\" where N is an\n              integer number and U is a time unit. Supported units are\n              's' (second), 'm' (minute), 'h' (hour) and 'd' /(day, as\n              in a 24 hour unit). The default time unit, if no \"/U\" is\n              provided, is number of transfers per hour.\n\n              If curl is told to allow 10 requests per minute, it does\n              not start the next request until 6 seconds have elapsed\n              since the previous transfer was started.\n\n              This function uses millisecond resolution. If the allowed\n              frequency is set more than 1000 per second, it instead\n              runs unrestricted.\n\n              When retrying transfers, enabled with--retry, the\n              separate retry delay logic is used and not this setting.\n\n              This option is global and does not need to be specified\n              for each use of --next.\n\n              If--rateis provided several times, the last set value is\n              used.\n\n              Examples:\n               curl --rate 2/shttps://example.com...\n               curl --rate 3/hhttps://example.com...\n               curl --rate 14/mhttps://example.com...\n\n              See also--limit-rateand--retry-delay. Added in 7.84.0.\n\n       --raw  (HTTP) When used, it disables all internal HTTP decoding\n              of content or transfer encodings and instead makes them\n              passed on unaltered, raw.\n\n              Providing--rawmultiple times has no extra effect.\n              Disable it again with --no-raw.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --rawhttps://example.comSee also--tr-encoding.\n\n       -e, --referer <URL>\n              (HTTP) Sends the \"Referrer Page\" information to the HTTP\n              server. This can also be set with the-H, --headerflag of\n              course. When used with-L, --locationyou can append\n              \";auto\" to the-e, --refererURL to make curl\n              automatically set the previous URL when it follows a\n              Location: header. The \";auto\" string can be used alone,\n              even if you do not set an initial-e, --referer.\n\n              If-e, --refereris provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Examples:\n               curl --referer \"https://fake.example\"https://example.comcurl --referer \"https://fake.example;auto\" -Lhttps://example.comcurl --referer \";auto\" -Lhttps://example.comSee also-A, --user-agentand-H, --header.\n\n       -J, --remote-header-name\n              (HTTP) This option tells the-O, --remote-nameoption to\n              use the server-specified Content-Disposition filename\n              instead of extracting a filename from the URL. If the\n              server-provided file name contains a path, that is\n              stripped off before the file name is used.\n\n              The file is saved in the current directory, or in the\n              directory specified with--output-dir.\n\n              If the server specifies a file name and a file with that\n              name already exists in the destination directory, it is\n              not overwritten and an error occurs - unless you allow it\n              by using the --clobber option. If the server does not\n              specify a file name then this option has no effect.\n\n              There is no attempt to decode %-sequences (yet) in the\n              provided file name, so this option may provide you with\n              rather unexpected file names.\n\n              This feature uses the name from the \"filename\" field, it\n              does not yet support the \"filename*\" field (filenames with\n              explicit character sets).WARNING: Exercise judicious use of this option, especially\n              on Windows. A rogue server could send you the name of a\n              DLL or other file that could be loaded automatically by\n              Windows or some third party software.\n\n              Providing-J, --remote-header-namemultiple times has no\n              extra effect.  Disable it again with\n              --no-remote-header-name.\n\n              Example:\n               curl -OJhttps://example.com/fileSee also-O, --remote-name.\n\n       -O, --remote-name\n              Write output to a local file named like the remote file we\n              get. (Only the file part of the remote file is used, the\n              path is cut off.)\n\n              The file is saved in the current working directory. If you\n              want the file saved in a different directory, make sure\n              you change the current working directory before invoking\n              curl with this option or use--output-dir.\n\n              The remote file name to use for saving is extracted from\n              the given URL, nothing else, and if it already exists it\n              is overwritten. If you want the server to be able to\n              choose the file name refer to-J, --remote-header-namewhich can be used in addition to this option. If the\n              server chooses a file name and that name already exists it\n              is not overwritten.\n\n              There is no URL decoding done on the file name. If it has\n              %20 or other URL encoded parts of the name, they end up\n              as-is as file name.\n\n              You may use this option as many times as the number of\n              URLs you have.-O, --remote-namecan be used several times in a command\n              line\n\n              Example:\n               curl -Ohttps://example.com/filenameSee also--remote-name-all,--output-dirand-J,--remote-header-name.\n\n       --remote-name-all\n              This option changes the default action for all given URLs\n              to be dealt with as if-O, --remote-namewere used for\n              each one. So if you want to disable that for a specific\n              URL after--remote-name-allhas been used, you must use\n              \"-o -\" or --no-remote-name.\n\n              Providing--remote-name-allmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --no-remote-name-all.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --remote-name-all ftp://example.com/file1 ftp://example.com/file2\n\n              See also-O, --remote-name.\n\n       -R, --remote-time\n              Makes curl attempt to figure out the timestamp of the\n              remote file that is getting downloaded, and if that is\n              available make the local file get that same timestamp.\n\n              Providing-R, --remote-timemultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --no-remote-time.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --remote-time -o foohttps://example.comSee also-O, --remote-nameand-z, --time-cond.\n\n       --remove-on-error\n              When curl returns an error when told to save output in a\n              local file, this option removes that saved file before\n              exiting. This prevents curl from leaving a partial file in\n              the case of an error during transfer.\n\n              If the output is not a file, this option has no effect.\n\n              Providing--remove-on-errormultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --no-remove-on-error.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --remove-on-error -o outputhttps://example.comSee also-f, --fail. Added in 7.83.0.\n\n       -X, --request <method>\n              Change the method to use when starting the transfer.\n\n              curl passes on the verbatim string you give it its the\n              request without any filter or other safe guards. That\n              includes white space and control characters.\n\n              HTTP   Specifies a custom request method to use when\n                     communicating with the HTTP server. The specified\n                     request method is used instead of the method\n                     otherwise used (which defaults toGET). Read the\n                     HTTP 1.1 specification for details and\n                     explanations. Common additional HTTP requests\n                     includePUTandDELETE, but related technologies\n                     like WebDAV offersPROPFIND,COPY,MOVEand more.\n\n                     Normally you do not need this option. All sorts ofGET,HEAD,POSTandPUTrequests are rather invoked\n                     by using dedicated command line options.\n\n                     This option only changes the actual word used in\n                     the HTTP request, it does not alter the way curl\n                     behaves. So for example if you want to make a\n                     proper HEAD request, using -X HEAD does not\n                     suffice. You need to use the-I, --headoption.\n\n                     The method string you set with-X, --requestis\n                     used for all requests, which if you for example use-L, --locationmay cause unintended side-effects\n                     when curl does not change request method according\n                     to the HTTP 30x response codes - and similar.\n\n              FTP    Specifies a custom FTP command to use instead ofLISTwhen doing file lists with FTP.\n\n              POP3   Specifies a custom POP3 command to use instead ofLISTorRETR.\n\n              IMAP   Specifies a custom IMAP command to use instead ofLIST.\n\n              SMTP   Specifies a custom SMTP command to use instead ofHELPorVRFY.\n\n              If-X, --requestis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Examples:\n               curl -X \"DELETE\"https://example.comcurl -X NLST ftp://example.com/\n\n              See also--request-target.\n\n       --request-target <path>\n              (HTTP) Tells curl to use an alternative \"target\" (path)\n              instead of using the path as provided in the URL.\n              Particularly useful when wanting to issue HTTP requests\n              without leading slash or other data that does not follow\n              the regular URL pattern, like \"OPTIONS *\".\n\n              curl passes on the verbatim string you give it its the\n              request without any filter or other safe guards. That\n              includes white space and control characters.\n\n              If--request-targetis provided several times, the last\n              set value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --request-target \"*\" -X OPTIONShttps://example.comSee also-X, --request. Added in 7.55.0.\n\n       --resolve <[+]host:port:addr[,addr]...>\n              Provide a custom address for a specific host and port\n              pair. Using this, you can make the curl requests(s) use a\n              specified address and prevent the otherwise normally\n              resolved address to be used. Consider it a sort of\n              /etc/hosts alternative provided on the command line. The\n              port number should be the number used for the specific\n              protocol the host is used for. It means you need several\n              entries if you want to provide address for the same host\n              but different ports.\n\n              By specifying '*' as host you can tell curl to resolve any\n              host and specific port pair to the specified address.\n              Wildcard is resolved last so any--resolvewith a specific\n              host and port is used first.\n\n              The provided address set by this option is used even if-4, --ipv4or-6, --ipv6is set to make curl use another\n              IP version.\n\n              By prefixing the host with a '+' you can make the entry\n              time out after curl's default timeout (1 minute). Note\n              that this only makes sense for long running parallel\n              transfers with a lot of files. In such cases, if this\n              option is used curl tries to resolve the host as it\n              normally would once the timeout has expired.\n\n              Support for providing the IP address within [brackets] was\n              added in 7.57.0.\n\n              Support for providing multiple IP addresses per entry was\n              added in 7.59.0.\n\n              Support for resolving with wildcard was added in 7.64.0.\n\n              Support for the '+' prefix was was added in 7.75.0.--resolvecan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Example:\n               curl --resolve example.com:443:127.0.0.1https://example.comSee also--connect-toand--alt-svc.\n\n       --retry <num>\n              If a transient error is returned when curl tries to\n              perform a transfer, it retries this number of times before\n              giving up. Setting the number to 0 makes curl do no\n              retries (which is the default). Transient error means\n              either: a timeout, an FTP 4xx response code or an HTTP\n              408, 429, 500, 502, 503 or 504 response code.\n\n              When curl is about to retry a transfer, it first waits one\n              second and then for all forthcoming retries it doubles the\n              waiting time until it reaches 10 minutes which then\n              remains delay between the rest of the retries. By using--retry-delayyou disable this exponential backoff\n              algorithm. See also--retry-max-timeto limit the total\n              time allowed for retries.\n\n              curl complies with the Retry-After: response header if one\n              was present to know when to issue the next retry (added in\n              7.66.0).\n\n              If--retryis provided several times, the last set value\n              is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --retry 7https://example.comSee also--retry-max-time.\n\n       --retry-all-errors\n              Retry on any error. This option is used together with--retry.\n\n              This option is the \"sledgehammer\" of retrying. Do not use\n              this option by default (for example in yourcurlrc), there\n              may be unintended consequences such as sending or\n              receiving duplicate data. Do not use with redirected input\n              or output. You'd be much better off handling your unique\n              problems in shell script. Please read the example below.WARNING: For server compatibility curl attempts to retry\n              failed flaky transfers as close as possible to how they\n              were started, but this is not possible with redirected\n              input or output. For example, before retrying it removes\n              output data from a failed partial transfer that was\n              written to an output file. However this is not true of\n              data redirected to a | pipe or > file, which are not\n              reset. We strongly suggest you do not parse or record\n              output via redirect in combination with this option, since\n              you may receive duplicate data.\n\n              By default curl does not return error for transfers with\n              an HTTP response code that indicates an HTTP error, if the\n              transfer was successful. For example, if a server replies\n              404 Not Found and the reply is fully received then that is\n              not an error. When--retryis used then curl retries on\n              some HTTP response codes that indicate transient HTTP\n              errors, but that does not include most 4xx response codes\n              such as 404. If you want to retry on all response codes\n              that indicate HTTP errors (4xx and 5xx) then combine with-f, --fail.\n\n              Providing--retry-all-errorsmultiple times has no extra\n              effect.

This\n              option is only interesting if--retryis also used.\n              Setting this delay to zero makes curl use the default\n              backoff time.\n\n              If--retry-delayis provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --retry-delay 5 --retry 7https://example.comSee also--retry.\n\n       --retry-max-time <seconds>\n              The retry timer is reset before the first transfer\n              attempt. Retries are done as usual (see--retry) as long\n              as the timer has not reached this given limit. Notice that\n              if the timer has not reached the limit, the request is\n              made and while performing, it may take longer than this\n              given time period.

You must use a trailing slash (/) on\n              the last directory to prove to curl that there is no file\n              name or curl thinks that your last directory name is the\n              remote file name to use.\n\n              When putting the local file name at the end of the URL,\n              curl ignores what is on the left side of any slash (/) or\n              backslash (\\) used in the file name and only appends what\n              is on the right side of the rightmost such character.\n\n              Use the file name \"-\" (a single dash) to use stdin instead\n              of a given file.  Alternately, the file name \".\" (a single\n              period) may be specified instead of \"-\" to use stdin in\n              non-blocking mode to allow reading server output while\n              stdin is being uploaded.\n\n              If this option is used with a HTTP(S) URL, the PUT method\n              is used.\n\n              You can specify one-T, --upload-filefor each URL on the\n              command line. Each-T, --upload-file+ URL pair specifies\n              what to upload and to where. curl also supports \"globbing\"\n              of the-T, --upload-fileargument, meaning that you can\n              upload multiple files to a single URL by using the same\n              URL globbing style supported in the URL.\n\n              When uploading to an SMTP server: the uploaded data is\n              assumed to be RFC 5322 formatted. It has to feature the\n              necessary set of headers and mail body formatted correctly\n              by the user as curl does not transcode nor encode it\n              further in any way.-T, --upload-filecan be used several times in a command\n              line\n\n              Examples:\n               curl -T filehttps://example.comcurl -T \"img[1-1000].png\" ftp://ftp.example.com/\n               curl --upload-file \"{file1,file2}\"https://example.comSee also-G, --get,-I, --head,-X, --requestand-d,--data.\n\n       --url <url>\n              Specify a URL to fetch. This option is mostly handy when\n              you want to specify URL(s) in a config file.\n\n              If the given URL is missing a scheme name (such as\n              \"http://\" or \"ftp://\" etc) then curl makes a guess based\n              on the host. If the outermost subdomain name matches DICT,\n              FTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3 or SMTP then that protocol is used,\n              otherwise HTTP is used. Guessing can be avoided by\n              providing a full URL including the scheme, or disabled by\n              setting a default protocol (added in 7.45.0), see--proto-defaultfor details.\n\n              To control where this URL is written, use the-o, --outputor the-O, --remote-nameoptions.WARNING: On Windows, particular file:// accesses can be\n              converted to network accesses by the operating system.\n              Beware!--urlcan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Example:\n               curl --urlhttps://example.comSee also-:, --nextand-K, --config.\n\n       --url-query <data>\n              (all) This option adds a piece of data, usually a name +\n              value pair, to the end of the URL query part. The syntax\n              is identical to that used for--data-urlencodewith one\n              extension:\n\n              If the argument starts with a '+' (plus), the rest of the\n              string is provided as-is unencoded.\n\n              The query part of a URL is the one following the question\n              mark on the right end.--url-querycan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Examples:\n               curl --url-query name=valhttps://example.comcurl --url-query =encodethishttp://example.net/foocurl --url-query name@filehttps://example.comcurl --url-query @fileonlyhttps://example.comcurl --url-query \"+name=%20foo\"https://example.comSee also--data-urlencodeand-G, --get. Added in 7.87.0.\n\n       -B, --use-ascii\n              (FTP LDAP) Enable ASCII transfer. For FTP, this can also\n              be enforced by using a URL that ends with \";type=A\". This\n              option causes data sent to stdout to be in text mode for\n              win32 systems.\n\n              Providing-B, --use-asciimultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --no-use-ascii.\n\n              Example:\n               curl -B ftp://example.com/README\n\n              See also--crlfand--data-ascii.\n\n       -u, --user <user:password>\n              Specify the user name and password to use for server\n              authentication. Overrides-n, --netrcand--netrc-optional.\n\n              If you simply specify the user name, curl prompts for a\n              password.\n\n              The user name and passwords are split up on the first\n              colon, which makes it impossible to use a colon in the\n              user name with this option. The password can, still.\n\n              On systems where it works, curl hides the given option\n              argument from process listings. This is not enough to\n              protect credentials from possibly getting seen by other\n              users on the same system as they still are visible for a\n              brief moment before cleared. Such sensitive data should be\n              retrieved from a file instead or similar and never used in\n              clear text in a command line.\n\n              When using Kerberos V5 with a Windows based server you\n              should include the Windows domain name in the user name,\n              in order for the server to successfully obtain a Kerberos\n              Ticket. If you do not, then the initial authentication\n              handshake may fail.\n\n              When using NTLM, the user name can be specified simply as\n              the user name, without the domain, if there is a single\n              domain and forest in your setup for example.\n\n              To specify the domain name use either Down-Level Logon\n              Name or UPN (User Principal Name) formats. For example,\n              EXAMPLE\\user and user@example.com respectively.\n\n              If you use a Windows SSPI-enabled curl binary and perform\n              Kerberos V5, Negotiate, NTLM or Digest authentication then\n              you can tell curl to select the user name and password\n              from your environment by specifying a single colon with\n              this option: \"-u :\".\n\n              If-u, --useris provided several times, the last set\n              value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl -u user:secrethttps://example.comSee also-n, --netrcand-K, --config.\n\n       -A, --user-agent <name>\n              (HTTP) Specify the User-Agent string to send to the HTTP\n              server. To encode blanks in the string, surround the\n              string with single quote marks. This header can also be\n              set with the-H, --headeror the--proxy-headeroptions.\n\n              If you give an empty argument to-A, --user-agent(\"\"), it\n              removes the header completely from the request. If you\n              prefer a blank header, you can set it to a single space (\"\n              \").\n\n              If-A, --user-agentis provided several times, the last\n              set value is used.\n\n              Example:\n               curl -A \"Agent 007\"https://example.comSee also-H, --headerand--proxy-header.\n\n       --variable <[%]name=text/@file>\n              Set a variable with \"name=content\" or \"name@file\" (where\n              \"file\" can be stdin if set to a single dash (-)). The name\n              is a case sensitive identifier that must consist of no\n              other letters than a-z, A-Z, 0-9 or underscore. The\n              specified content is then associated with this identifier.\n\n              Setting the same variable name again overwrites the old\n              contents with the new.\n\n              The contents of a variable can be referenced in a later\n              command line option when that option name is prefixed with\n              \"--expand-\", and the name is used as \"{{name}}\" (without\n              the quotes).--variablecan import environment variables into the name\n              space. Opt to either require the environment variable to\n              be set or provide a default value for the variable in case\n              it is not already set.--variable%name imports the variable called 'name' but\n              exits with an error if that environment variable is not\n              already set. To provide a default value if the environment\n              variable is not set, use--variable%name=content or--variable%name@content. Note that on some systems - but\n              not all - environment variables are case insensitive.\n\n              When expanding variables, curl supports a set of functions\n              that can make the variable contents more convenient to\n              use. You apply a function to a variable expansion by\n              adding a colon and then list the desired functions in a\n              comma-separated list that is evaluated in a left-to-right\n              order. Variable content holding null bytes that are not\n              encoded when expanded, causes an error.\n\n              Available functions:\n\n              trim   removes all leading and trailing white space.\n\n              json   outputs the content using JSON string quoting\n                     rules.\n\n              url    shows the content URL (percent) encoded.\n\n              b64    expands the variable base64 encoded--variablecan be used several times in a command line\n\n              Example:\n               curl --variable name=smithhttps://example.comSee also-K, --config. Added in 8.3.0.\n\n       -v, --verbose\n              Makes curl verbose during the operation. Useful for\n              debugging and seeing what's going on \"under the hood\". A\n              line starting with '>' means \"header data\" sent by curl,\n              '<' means \"header data\" received by curl that is hidden in\n              normal cases, and a line starting with '*' means\n              additional info provided by curl.\n\n              If you only want HTTP headers in the output,-i, --includeor-D, --dump-headermight be more suitable options.\n\n              If you think this option still does not give you enough\n              details, consider using--traceor--trace-asciiinstead.\n\n              Note that verbose output of curl activities and network\n              traffic might contain sensitive data, including user\n              names, credentials or secret data content. Be aware and be\n              careful when sharing trace logs with others.\n\n              This option is global and does not need to be specified\n              for each use of --next.\n\n              Providing-v, --verbosemultiple times has no extra\n              effect.  Disable it again with --no-verbose.\n\n              Example:\n               curl --verbosehttps://example.comSee also-i, --include,-s, --silent,--traceand--trace-ascii. This option is mutually exclusive to--traceand--trace-ascii.\n\n       -V, --version\n              Displays information about curl and the libcurl version it\n              uses.\n\n              The first line includes the full version of curl, libcurl\n              and other 3rd party libraries linked with the executable.\n\n              The second line (starts with \"Release-Date:\") shows the\n              release date.\n\n              The third line (starts with \"Protocols:\") shows all\n              protocols that libcurl reports to support.\n\n              The fourth line (starts with \"Features:\") shows specific\n              features libcurl reports to offer.

The format is a string that may contain plain\n              text mixed with any number of variables. The format can be\n              specified as a literal \"string\", or you can have curl read\n              the format from a file with \"@filename\" and to tell curl\n              to read the format from stdin you write \"@-\".\n\n              The variables present in the output format are substituted\n              by the value or text that curl thinks fit, as described\n              below. All variables are specified as %{variable_name} and\n              to output a normal % you just write them as %%. You can\n              output a newline by using \\n, a carriage return with \\r\n              and a tab space with \\t.\n\n              The output is by default written to standard output, but\n              can be changed with %{stderr} and %output{}.\n\n              Output HTTP headers from the most recent request by using%header{name}wherenameis the case insensitive name of\n              the header (without the trailing colon). The header\n              contents are exactly as sent over the network, with\n              leading and trailing whitespace trimmed (added in 7.84.0).\n\n              Select a specific target destination file to write the\n              output to, by using%output{name}(added in curl 8.3.0)\n              wherenameis the full file name. The output following\n              that instruction is then written to that file. More than\n              one%output{}instruction can be specified in the same\n              write-out argument. If the file name cannot be created,\n              curl leaves the output destination to the one used prior\n              to the%output{}instruction. Use%output{>>name}to\n              append data to an existing file.NOTE:In Windows the %-symbol is a special symbol used to\n              expand environment variables. In batch files all\n              occurrences of % must be doubled when using this option to\n              properly escape. If this option is used at the command\n              prompt then the % cannot be escaped and unintended\n              expansion is possible.\n\n              The variables available are:\n\n              certs  Output the certificate chain with details.\n                     Supported only by the OpenSSL, GnuTLS, Schannel and\n                     Secure Transport backends.

Thefoldutility should be used when the contents of\n       long lines need to be kept contiguous.\n\n       Earlier versions of thecututility worked in an environment\n       where bytes and characters were considered equivalent (modulo\n       <backspace> and <tab> processing in some implementations). In the\n       extended world of multi-byte characters, the new-boption has\n       been added. The-noption (used with-b) allows it to be used to\n       act on bytes rounded to character boundaries.  The algorithm\n       specified for-nguarantees that:\n\n           cut -b 1-500 -n file > file1\n           cut -b 501- -n file > file2\n\n       ends up with all the characters infileappearing exactly once infile1orfile2.

Thepasteutility can be used to create (or recreate) files with\n       arbitrary line lengths. For example, iffilecontains long lines:\n\n           cut -b 1-500 -n file > file1\n           cut -b 501- -n file > file2\n\n       createsfile1(a text file) with lines no longer than 500 bytes\n       (plus the <newline>) andfile2that contains the remainder of the\n       data fromfile.  (Note thatfile2is not a text file if there are\n       lines infilethat are longer than 500 + {LINE_MAX} bytes.) The\n       original file can be recreated fromfile1andfile2using the\n       command:\n\n           paste -d \"\\0\" file1 file2 > file",

It\n       was deliberately decided not to have the-coption treat either\n       <backspace> or <tab> characters in any special fashion. Thefoldutility does treat these characters specially.\n\n       Unlike other utilities, some historical implementations ofcutexit after not finding an input file, rather than continuing to\n       process the remainingfileoperands. This behavior is prohibited\n       by this volume of POSIX.1\u20102017, where only the exit status is\n       affected by this problem.\n\n       The behavior ofcutwhen provided with either mutually-exclusive\n       options or options that do not work logically together has been\n       deliberately left unspecified in favor of global wording inSection 1.4,Utility Description Defaults.\n\n       The OPTIONS section was changed in response to IEEE PASC\n       Interpretation 1003.2 #149. The change represents historical\n       practice on all known systems.

        "description": "Thecvtsudoersutility accepts one or more security policies in\n       eithersudoersor LDIF format as input, and generates a single\n       policy of the specified format as output.  The default input\n       format issudoers.The default output format is LDIF.  It is only\n       possible to convert a policy file that is syntactically correct.\n\n       If noinput_fileis specified, or if it is \u2018-\u2019, the policy is\n       read from the standard input.  Input files may be optionally\n       prefixed with a host name followed by a colon (\u2018:\u2019) to make the\n       policy rules specific to a host when merging multiple files.  By\n       default, the result is written to the standard output.\n\n       The options are as follows:-bdn,--base=dnThe base DN (distinguished name) that will be used when\n               performing LDAP queries.  Typically this is of the form\n               \u201cou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com\u201d for the domain my-\n               domain.com.

Aliases are preserved by\n               default when the outputformatis JSON or sudoers.-foutput_format,--output-format=output_formatSpecify the output format (case-insensitive).  The\n               following formats are supported:\n\n               CSV      CSV (comma-separated value) files are often used\n                        by spreadsheets and report generators.  See \u201cCSV\n                        output format\u201d for more details.\n\n               JSON     JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are\n                        usually easier for third-party applications to\n                        consume than the traditionalsudoersformat.\n                        The various values have explicit types which\n                        removes much of the ambiguity of thesudoersformat.  See \u201cJSON output format\u201d for more\n                        details.\n\n               LDIF     LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files can be\n                        imported into an LDAP server for use withsudoers.ldap(5).\n\n                        Conversion to LDIF has the following\n                        limitations:\u2022Command, host, runas, and user-specific\n                           Defaults lines cannot be translated as they\n                           don't have an equivalent in the sudoers LDAP\n                           schema.\u2022Command, host, runas, and user aliases are\n                           not supported by the sudoers LDAP schema so\n                           they are expanded during the conversion.\n\n               sudoers  Traditional sudoers format.  A new sudoers file\n                        will be reconstructed from the parsed input\n                        file.  Comments are not preserved and data from\n                        any include files will be output inline.--group-file=fileWhen the-Moption is also specified, perform group\n               queries usingfileinstead of the system group database.-h,--helpDisplay a short help message to the standard output and\n               exit.-iinput_format,--input-format=input_formatSpecify the input format.  The following formats are\n               supported:\n\n               LDIF     LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files can be\n                        exported from an LDAP server to convert security\n                        policies used bysudoers.ldap(5).  If a base DN\n                        (distinguished name) is specified, only sudoRole\n                        objects that match the base DN will be\n                        processed.  Not all sudoOptions specified in a\n                        sudoRole can be translated from LDIF to sudoers\n                        format.\n\n               sudoers  Traditional sudoers format.  This is the default\n                        input format.-Iincrement,--increment=incrementWhen generating LDIF output, increment each sudoOrder\n               attribute by the specified number.  Defaults to an\n               increment of 1.-llog_file,--logfile=log_fileLog conversion warnings tolog_fileinstead of to the\n               standard error.  This is particularly useful when merging\n               multiplesudoersfiles, which can generate a large number\n               of warnings.-mfilter,--match=filterOnly output rules that match the specifiedfilter.  Afilterexpression is made up of one or morekey =valuepairs, separated by a comma (\u2018,\u2019).  Thekeymay be \u201ccmnd\u201d\n               (or \u201ccmd\u201d), \u201chost\u201d, \u201cgroup\u201d, or \u201cuser\u201d.  For example,user=operatororhost=www.  An upper-caseCmnd_Alias,Host_alias, orUser_Aliasmay be specified as the \u201ccmnd\u201d,\n               \u201chost\u201d, or \u201cuser\u201d.\n\n               A matchingsudoersrule may also include users, groups,\n               and hosts that are not part of thefilter.  This can\n               happen when a rule includes multiple users, groups, or\n               hosts.  To prune out any non-matching user, group, or\n               host from the rules, the-poption may be used.\n\n               By default, the password and group databases are not\n               consulted when matching against the filter so the users\n               and groups do not need to be present on the local system\n               (see the-Moption).  Only aliases that are referenced by\n               the filtered policy rules will be displayed.-M,--match-localWhen the-moption is also specified, use password and\n               group database information when matching users and groups\n               in the filter.  Only users and groups in the filter that\n               exist on the local system will match, and a user's groups\n               will automatically be added to the filter.  If the-Misnotspecified, users and groups in the filter do not need\n               to exist on the local system, but all groups used for\n               matching must be explicitly listed in the filter.-ooutput_file,--output=output_fileWrite the converted output tooutput_file.  If nooutput_fileis specified, or if it is \u2018-\u2019, the convertedsudoerspolicy will be written to the standard output.-Ostart_point,--order-start=start_pointWhen generating LDIF output, use the number specified bystart_pointin the sudoOrder attribute of the first\n               sudoRole object.  Subsequent sudoRole object use a\n               sudoOrder value generated by adding anincrement, see the-Ioption for details.  Defaults to a starting point of\n               1.  A starting point of 0 will disable the generation of\n               sudoOrder attributes in the resulting LDIF file.--passwd-file=fileWhen the-Moption is also specified, perform passwd\n               queries usingfileinstead of the system passwd database.-p,--prune-matchesWhen the-moption is also specified,cvtsudoerswill\n               prune out non-matching users, groups, and hosts from\n               matching entries.-Ppadding,--padding=paddingWhen generating LDIF output, construct the initial\n               sudoOrder value by concatenatingorder_startandincrement, padding theincrementwith zeros until it\n               consists ofpaddingdigits.  For example, iforder_startis 1027,paddingis 3, andincrementis 1, the value of\n               sudoOrder for the first entry will be 1027000, followed\n               by 1027001, 1027002, etc.  If the number of sudoRole\n               entries is larger than the padding would allow,cvtsudoerswill exit with an error.  By default, no\n               padding is performed.-ssections,--suppress=sectionsSuppress the output of specificsectionsof the security\n               policy.  One or more section names may be specified,\n               separated by a comma (\u2018,\u2019).  The supported section name\n               are:defaults,aliasesandprivileges(which may be\n               shortened toprivs).-V,--versionPrint thecvtsudoersandsudoersgrammar versions and\n               exit.Merging multiple filesWhen multiple input files are specified,cvtsudoerswill attempt\n       to merge them into a single policy file.  It is assumed that user\n       and group names are consistent among the policy files to be\n       merged.  For example, user \u201cbob\u201d on one host is the same as user\n       \u201cbob\u201d on another host.\n\n       When merging policy files, it is possible to prefix the input\n       file name with a host name, separated by a colon (\u2018:\u2019).  When the\n       files are merged, the host name will be used to restrict the\n       policy rules to that specific host where possible.\n\n       The merging process is performed as follows:\u2022Each input file is parsed into internal sudoers data\n          structures.\u2022Aliases are merged and renamed as necessary to avoid\n          conflicts.  In the event of a conflict, the first alias found\n          is left as-is and subsequent aliases of the same name are\n          renamed with a numeric suffix separated with a underscore\n          (\u2018_\u2019).  For example, if there are two different aliases named\n          SERVERS, the first will be left as-is and the second will be\n          renamed SERVERS_1.  References to the renamed alias are also\n          updated in the policy file.  Duplicate aliases (those with\n          identical contents) are pruned.\u2022Defaults settings are merged and duplicates are removed.  If\n          there are conflicts in the Defaults settings, a warning is\n          emitted for each conflict.  If a host name is specified with\n          the input file,cvtsudoerswill change the global Defaults\n          settings in that file to be host-specific.  A warning is\n          emitted for command, user, or runas-specific Defaults settings\n          which cannot be made host-specific.\u2022Per-user rules are merged and duplicates are removed.  If a\n          host name is specified with the input file,cvtsudoerswill\n          change rules that specify a host name ofALLto the host name\n          associated with the policy file being merged.  The merging of\n          rules is currently fairly simplistic but will be improved in a\n          later release.\n\n       It is possible to merge policy files with differing formats.The cvtsudoers.conf fileOptions in the form \u201ckeyword = value\u201d may also be specified in a\n       configuration file,/etc/cvtsudoers.confby default.

If aBindingis present, the setting will only\n             take effect if one of the specifiedcommand,hostname,netgroup,networkaddr,nonunixgid,nonunixgroup,usergid,usergroup,userid,username, or alias entries match.\n\n             For example, the followingsudoersentry:\n\n             Defaults@somehost set_home, env_keep += DISPLAY\n\n             converts to:\n\n             \"Defaults\": [\n                 {\n                     \"Binding\": [\n                         { \"hostname\": \"somehost\" }\n                     ],\n                     \"Options\": [\n                         { \"set_home\": true },\n                         {\n                             \"operation\": \"list_add\",\n                             \"env_keep\": [\n                                 \"DISPLAY\"\n                             ]\n                         }\n                     ]\n                 }\n             ]\n\n       User_Aliases\n             A JSON object containing one or moresudoers User_Aliasentries where each named alias has as its value an array\n             containing one or more objects.  Each object contains a\n             \u201cname:value\u201d pair and an optionalnegatedentry, which will\n             negate any comparison performed with the object.  The name\n             may be one ofnetgroup,nonunixgid,nonunixgroup,useralias,usergid,usergroup,userid, orusername.\n\n             For example, the followingsudoersentry:\n\n             User_Alias SYSADMIN = will, %wheel, +admin\n\n             converts to:\n\n             \"User_Aliases\": {\n                 \"SYSADMIN\": [\n                     { \"username\": \"will\" },\n                     { \"usergroup\": \"wheel\" },\n                     { \"netgroup\": \"admin\" }\n                 ]\n             }\n\n       Runas_Aliases\n             A JSON object containing one or moresudoers Runas_Aliasentries, where each named alias has as its value an array\n             containing one or more objects.

        "description": "dashis the standard command interpreter for the system.  The\n       current version ofdashis in the process of being changed to\n       conform with the POSIX 1003.2 and 1003.2a specifications for the\n       shell.  This version has many features which make it appear\n       similar in some respects to the Korn shell, but it is not a Korn\n       shell clone (seeksh(1)).  Only features designated by POSIX,\n       plus a few Berkeley extensions, are being incorporated into this\n       shell.  This man page is not intended to be a tutorial or a\n       complete specification of the shell.OverviewThe shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the\n       terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands.\n       It is the program that is running when a user logs into the\n       system (although a user can select a different shell with thechsh(1) command).  The shell implements a language that has flow\n       control constructs, a macro facility that provides a variety of\n       features in addition to data storage, along with built in history\n       and line editing capabilities.  It incorporates many features to\n       aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative\n       language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use\n       (shell scripts).  That is, commands can be typed directly to the\n       running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be\n       executed directly by the shell.InvocationIf no args are present and if the standard input of the shell is\n       connected to a terminal (or if the-iflag is set), and the-coption is not present, the shell is considered an interactive\n       shell.  An interactive shell generally prompts before each\n       command and handles programming and command errors differently\n       (as described below).  When first starting, the shell inspects\n       argument 0, and if it begins with a dash \u2018-\u2019, the shell is also\n       considered a login shell.  This is normally done automatically by\n       the system when the user first logs in.  A login shell first\n       reads commands from the files/etc/profileand.profileif they\n       exist.  If the environment variable ENV is set on entry to an\n       interactive shell, or is set in the.profileof a login shell,\n       the shell next reads commands from the file named in ENV.\n       Therefore, a user should place commands that are to be executed\n       only at login time in the.profilefile, and commands that are\n       executed for every interactive shell inside the ENV file.  To set\n       the ENV variable to some file, place the following line in your.profileof your home directoryENV=$HOME/.shinit; export ENVsubstituting for \u201c.shinit\u201d any filename you wish.\n\n       If command line arguments besides the options have been\n       specified, then the shell treats the first argument as the name\n       of a file from which to read commands (a shell script), and the\n       remaining arguments are set as the positional parameters of the\n       shell ($1, $2, etc).  Otherwise, the shell reads commands from\n       its standard input.Argument List ProcessingAll of the single letter options that have a corresponding name\n       can be used as an argument to the-ooption.  The set-oname is\n       provided next to the single letter option in the description\n       below.  Specifying a dash \u201c-\u201d turns the option on, while using a\n       plus \u201c+\u201d disables the option.  The following options can be set\n       from the command line or with thesetbuiltin (described later).-aallexportExport all variables assigned to.-cRead commands from thecommand_stringoperand instead of from the standard\n                              input.

(UNIMPLEMENTED\n                              for 4.4alpha)Lexical StructureThe shell reads input in terms of lines from a file and breaks it\n       up into words at whitespace (blanks and tabs), and at certain\n       sequences of characters that are special to the shell called\n       \u201coperators\u201d.  There are two types of operators: control operators\n       and redirection operators (their meaning is discussed later).\n       Following is a list of operators:\n\n             Control operators:& && ( ) ; ;;||| <newline>Redirection operators:< > >| << >> <& >& <<- <>QuotingQuoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain\n       characters or words to the shell, such as operators, whitespace,\n       or keywords.  There are three types of quoting: matched single\n       quotes, matched double quotes, and backslash.BackslashA backslash preserves the literal meaning of the following\n       character, with the exception of \u27e8newline\u27e9.  A backslash\n       preceding a \u27e8newline\u27e9 is treated as a line continuation.Single QuotesEnclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal\n       meaning of all the characters (except single quotes, making it\n       impossible to put single-quotes in a single-quoted string).Double QuotesEnclosing characters within double quotes preserves the literal\n       meaning of all characters except dollarsign ($), backquote (`),\n       and backslash (\\).  The backslash inside double quotes is\n       historically weird, and serves to quote only the following\n       characters:$ ` \" \\ <newline>.\n       Otherwise it remains literal.Reserved WordsReserved words are words that have special meaning to the shell\n       and are recognized at the beginning of a line and after a control\n       operator.  The following are reserved words:\n\n             !       elif    fi      while   case\n             else    for     then    {       }\n             do      done    until   if      esac\n\n       Their meaning is discussed later.AliasesAn alias is a name and corresponding value set using thealias(1)\n       builtin command.  Whenever a reserved word may occur (see above),\n       and after checking for reserved words, the shell checks the word\n       to see if it matches an alias.  If it does, it replaces it in the\n       input stream with its value.  For example, if there is an alias\n       called \u201clf\u201d with the value \u201cls -F\u201d, then the input:lf foobar\u27e8return\u27e9\n\n       would becomels -F foobar\u27e8return\u27e9\n\n       Aliases provide a convenient way for naive users to create\n       shorthands for commands without having to learn how to create\n       functions with arguments.  They can also be used to create\n       lexically obscure code.  This use is discouraged.CommandsThe shell interprets the words it reads according to a language,\n       the specification of which is outside the scope of this man page\n       (refer to the BNF in the POSIX 1003.2 document).  Essentially\n       though, a line is read and if the first word of the line (or\n       after a control operator) is not a reserved word, then the shell\n       has recognized a simple command.  Otherwise, a complex command or\n       some other special construct may have been recognized.Simple CommandsIf a simple command has been recognized, the shell performs the\n       following actions:\n\n             1.   Leading words of the form \u201cname=value\u201d are stripped\n                  off and assigned to the environment of the simple\n                  command.  Redirection operators and their arguments\n                  (as described below) are stripped off and saved for\n                  processing.\n\n             2.   The remaining words are expanded as described in the\n                  section called \u201cExpansions\u201d, and the first remaining\n                  word is considered the command name and the command is\n                  located.  The remaining words are considered the\n                  arguments of the command.  If no command name\n                  resulted, then the \u201cname=value\u201d variable assignments\n                  recognized in item 1 affect the current shell.\n\n             3.   Redirections are performed as described in the next\n                  section.RedirectionsRedirections are used to change where a command reads its input\n       or sends its output.  In general, redirections open, close, or\n       duplicate an existing reference to a file.  The overall format\n       used for redirection is:[n]redir-op filewhereredir-opis one of the redirection operators mentioned\n       previously.  Following is a list of the possible redirections.\n       The [n] is an optional number between 0 and 9, as in \u20183\u2019 (not\n       \u2018[3]\u2019), that refers to a file descriptor.\n\n             [n]> file   Redirect standard output (or n) to file.\n\n             [n]>| file  Same, but override the-Coption.\n\n             [n]>> file  Append standard output (or n) to file.\n\n             [n]< file   Redirect standard input (or n) from file.\n\n             [n1]<&n2    Copy file descriptor n2 as stdin (or fd n1).\n\n             [n]<&-      Close standard input (or n).\n\n             [n1]>&n2    Copy file descriptor n2 as stdout (or fd n1).\n\n             [n]>&-      Close standard output (or n).\n\n             [n]<> file  Open file for reading and writing on standard\n                         input (or n).\n\n       The following redirection is often called a \u201chere-document\u201d.[n]<< delimiterhere-doc-text ...delimiterAll the text on successive lines up to the delimiter is saved\n       away and made available to the command on standard input, or file\n       descriptor n if it is specified.  If the delimiter as specified\n       on the initial line is quoted, then the here-doc-text is treated\n       literally, otherwise the text is subjected to parameter\n       expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion (as\n       described in the section on \u201cExpansions\u201d).  If the operator is\n       \u201c<<-\u201d instead of \u201c<<\u201d, then leading tabs in the here-doc-text are\n       stripped.Search and ExecutionThere are three types of commands: shell functions, builtin\n       commands, and normal programs \u2013 and the command is searched for\n       (by name) in that order.  They each are executed in a different\n       way.\n\n       When a shell function is executed, all of the shell positional\n       parameters (except $0, which remains unchanged) are set to the\n       arguments of the shell function.  The variables which are\n       explicitly placed in the environment of the command (by placing\n       assignments to them before the function name) are made local to\n       the function and are set to the values given.  Then the command\n       given in the function definition is executed.  The positional\n       parameters are restored to their original values when the command\n       completes.  This all occurs within the current shell.\n\n       Shell builtins are executed internally to the shell, without\n       spawning a new process.\n\n       Otherwise, if the command name doesn't match a function or\n       builtin, the command is searched for as a normal program in the\n       file system (as described in the next section).  When a normal\n       program is executed, the shell runs the program, passing the\n       arguments and the environment to the program.  If the program is\n       not a normal executable file (i.e., if it does not begin with the\n       \"magic number\" whose ASCII representation is \"#!\", soexecve(2)\n       returns ENOEXEC then) the shell will interpret the program in a\n       subshell.  The child shell will reinitialize itself in this case,\n       so that the effect will be as if a new shell had been invoked to\n       handle the ad-hoc shell script, except that the location of\n       hashed commands located in the parent shell will be remembered by\n       the child.\n\n       Note that previous versions of this document and the source code\n       itself misleadingly and sporadically refer to a shell script\n       without a magic number as a \"shell procedure\".Path SearchWhen locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a\n       shell function by that name.  Then it looks for a builtin command\n       by that name.  If a builtin command is not found, one of two\n       things happen:\n\n       1.   Command names containing a slash are simply executed without\n            performing any searches.\n\n       2.   The shell searches each entry in PATH in turn for the\n            command.  The value of the PATH variable should be a series\n            of entries separated by colons.  Each entry consists of a\n            directory name.  The current directory may be indicated\n            implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a\n            single period.Command Exit StatusEach command has an exit status that can influence the behaviour\n       of other shell commands.  The paradigm is that a command exits\n       with zero for normal or success, and non-zero for failure, error,\n       or a false indication.  The man page for each command should\n       indicate the various exit codes and what they mean.\n       Additionally, the builtin commands return exit codes, as does an\n       executed shell function.\n\n       If a command consists entirely of variable assignments then the\n       exit status of the command is that of the last command\n       substitution if any, otherwise 0.Complex CommandsComplex commands are combinations of simple commands with control\n       operators or reserved words, together creating a larger complex\n       command.  More generally, a command is one of the following:\u2022simple command\u2022pipeline\u2022list or compound-list\u2022compound command\u2022function definition\n\n       Unless otherwise stated, the exit status of a command is that of\n       the last simple command executed by the command.PipelinesA pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the\n       control operator |.  The standard output of all but the last\n       command is connected to the standard input of the next command.\n       The standard output of the last command is inherited from the\n       shell, as usual.\n\n       The format for a pipeline is:[!] command1[|command2 ...]The standard output of command1 is connected to the standard\n       input of command2.  The standard input, standard output, or both\n       of a command is considered to be assigned by the pipeline before\n       any redirection specified by redirection operators that are part\n       of the command.\n\n       If the pipeline is not in the background (discussed later), the\n       shell waits for all commands to complete.\n\n       If thepipefailoption was enabled when the shell began execution\n       of the pipeline, the pipeline's exit status is the exit status of\n       the last command specified in the pipeline that exited with non-\n       zero status, or zero if all commands in the pipeline exited with\n       a status of zero. If thepipefailoption was not enabled, the\n       pipeline's exit status is the exit status of the last command\n       specified in the pipeline; the exit statuses of any other\n       commands are not used. If the reserved word ! precedes the\n       pipeline, its exit status is the logical NOT of the exit status\n       described above.\n\n       Because pipeline assignment of standard input or standard output\n       or both takes place before redirection, it can be modified by\n       redirection.  For example:$ command1 2>&1|command2sends both the standard output and standard error of command1 to\n       the standard input of command2.\n\n       A ; or \u27e8newline\u27e9 terminator causes the preceding AND-OR-list\n       (described next) to be executed sequentially; a & causes\n       asynchronous execution of the preceding AND-OR-list.\n\n       Note that unlike some other shells, each process in the pipeline\n       is a child of the invoking shell (unless it is a shell builtin,\n       in which case it executes in the current shell \u2013 but any effect\n       it has on the environment is wiped).Background Commands \u2013 &If a command is terminated by the control operator ampersand (&),\n       the shell executes the command asynchronously \u2013 that is, the\n       shell does not wait for the command to finish before executing\n       the next command.\n\n       The format for running a command in background is:command1 & [command2 & ...]If the shell is not interactive, the standard input of an\n       asynchronous command is set to/dev/null.Lists \u2013 Generally SpeakingA list is a sequence of zero or more commands separated by\n       newlines, semicolons, or ampersands, and optionally terminated by\n       one of these three characters.  The commands in a list are\n       executed in the order they are written.  If command is followed\n       by an ampersand, the shell starts the command and immediately\n       proceeds onto the next command; otherwise it waits for the\n       command to terminate before proceeding to the next one.Short-Circuit List Operators\u201c&&\u201d and \u201c||\u201d are AND-OR list operators.  \u201c&&\u201d executes the first\n       command, and then executes the second command if and only if the\n       exit status of the first command is zero.  \u201c||\u201d is similar, but\n       executes the second command if and only if the exit status of the\n       first command is nonzero.  \u201c&&\u201d and \u201c||\u201d both have the same\n       priority.Flow-Control Constructs \u2013 if, while, for, caseThe syntax of the if command is\n\n             if list\n             then list\n             [ elif list\n             then    list ] ...\n             [ else list ]\n             fi\n\n       The syntax of the while command is\n\n             while list\n             do   list\n             done\n\n       The two lists are executed repeatedly while the exit status of\n       the first list is zero.  The until command is similar, but has\n       the word until in place of while, which causes it to repeat until\n       the exit status of the first list is zero.\n\n       The syntax of the for command is\n\n             for variable [ in [ word ... ] ]\n             do   list\n             done\n\n       The words followinginare expanded, and then the list is\n       executed repeatedly with the variable set to each word in turn.\n       Omitting in word ... is equivalent to in \"$@\".\n\n       The syntax of the break and continue command is\n\n             break [ num ]\n             continue [ num ]\n\n       Break terminates the num innermost for or while loops.  Continue\n       continues with the next iteration of the innermost loop.  These\n       are implemented as builtin commands.\n\n       The syntax of the case command is\n\n             case word in\n             [(]pattern) list ;;\n             ...\n             esac\n\n       The pattern can actually be one or more patterns (see \u201cShell\n       Patterns\u201d described later), separated by \u201c|\u201d characters.  The \u201c(\u201d\n       character before the pattern is optional.Grouping Commands TogetherCommands may be grouped by writing either(list)or{ list; }The first of these executes the commands in a subshell.  Builtin\n       commands grouped into a (list) will not affect the current shell.\n       The second form does not fork another shell so is slightly more\n       efficient.  Grouping commands together this way allows you to\n       redirect their output as though they were one program:\n\n             { printf \" hello \" ; printf \" world\\n\" ; } > greeting\n\n       Note that \u201c}\u201d must follow a control operator (here, \u201c;\u201d) so that\n       it is recognized as a reserved word and not as another command\n       argument.FunctionsThe syntax of a function definition isname()commandA function definition is an executable statement; when executed\n       it installs a function named name and returns an exit status of\n       zero.  The command is normally a list enclosed between \u201c{\u201d and\n       \u201c}\u201d.\n\n       Variables may be declared to be local to a function by using a\n       local command.  This should appear as the first statement of a\n       function, and the syntax islocal[variable|-]...Local is implemented as a builtin command.\n\n       When a variable is made local, it inherits the initial value and\n       exported and readonly flags from the variable with the same name\n       in the surrounding scope, if there is one.  Otherwise, the\n       variable is initially unset.  The shell uses dynamic scoping, so\n       that if you make the variable x local to function f, which then\n       calls function g, references to the variable x made inside g will\n       refer to the variable x declared inside f, not to the global\n       variable named x.\n\n       The only special parameter that can be made local is \u201c-\u201d.  Making\n       \u201c-\u201d local any shell options that are changed via the set command\n       inside the function to be restored to their original values when\n       the function returns.\n\n       The syntax of the return command isreturn[exitstatus]\n\n       It terminates the currently executing function.  Return is\n       implemented as a builtin command.Variables and ParametersThe shell maintains a set of parameters.  A parameter denoted by\n       a name is called a variable.  When starting up, the shell turns\n       all the environment variables into shell variables.  New\n       variables can be set using the formname=valueVariables set by the user must have a name consisting solely of\n       alphabetics, numerics, and underscores - the first of which must\n       not be numeric.  A parameter can also be denoted by a number or a\n       special character as explained below.Positional ParametersA positional parameter is a parameter denoted by a number (n >\n       0).  The shell sets these initially to the values of its command\n       line arguments that follow the name of the shell script.  Thesetbuiltin can also be used to set or reset them.Special ParametersA special parameter is a parameter denoted by one of the\n       following special characters.  The value of the parameter is\n       listed next to its character.\n\n       *            Expands to the positional parameters, starting from\n                    one.  When the expansion occurs within a double-\n                    quoted string it expands to a single field with the\n                    value of each parameter separated by the first\n                    character of the IFS variable, or by a \u27e8space\u27e9 if\n                    IFS is unset.\n\n       @            Expands to the positional parameters, starting from\n                    one.  When the expansion occurs within double-\n                    quotes, each positional parameter expands as a\n                    separate argument.  If there are no positional\n                    parameters, the expansion of @ generates zero\n                    arguments, even when @ is double-quoted.  What this\n                    basically means, for example, is if $1 is \u201cabc\u201d and\n                    $2 is \u201cdef ghi\u201d, then \"$@\" expands to the two\n                    arguments:\"abc\" \"def ghi\"#            Expands to the number of positional parameters.\n\n       ?            Expands to the exit status of the most recent\n                    pipeline.\n\n       - (Hyphen.)  Expands to the current option flags (the single-\n                    letter option names concatenated into a string) as\n                    specified on invocation, by the set builtin command,\n                    or implicitly by the shell.\n\n       $            Expands to the process ID of the invoked shell.  A\n                    subshell retains the same value of $ as its parent.\n\n       !            Expands to the process ID of the most recent\n                    background command executed from the current shell.\n                    For a pipeline, the process ID is that of the last\n                    command in the pipeline.\n\n       0 (Zero.)    Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.Word ExpansionsThis clause describes the various expansions that are performed\n       on words.  Not all expansions are performed on every word, as\n       explained later.\n\n       Tilde expansions, parameter expansions, command substitutions,\n       arithmetic expansions, and quote removals that occur within a\n       single word expand to a single field.  It is only field splitting\n       or pathname expansion that can create multiple fields from a\n       single word.  The single exception to this rule is the expansion\n       of the special parameter @ within double-quotes, as was described\n       above.\n\n       The order of word expansion is:\n\n       1.   Tilde Expansion, Parameter Expansion, Command Substitution,\n            Arithmetic Expansion (these all occur at the same time).\n\n       2.   Field Splitting is performed on fields generated by step (1)\n            unless the IFS variable is null.\n\n       3.   Pathname Expansion (unless set-fis in effect).\n\n       4.   Quote Removal.\n\n       The $ character is used to introduce parameter expansion, command\n       substitution, or arithmetic evaluation.Tilde Expansion (substituting a user's home directory)A word beginning with an unquoted tilde character (~) is\n       subjected to tilde expansion.  All the characters up to a slash\n       (/) or the end of the word are treated as a username and are\n       replaced with the user's home directory.  If the username is\n       missing (as in~/foobar), the tilde is replaced with the value of\n       theHOMEvariable (the current user's home directory).Parameter ExpansionThe format for parameter expansion is as follows:${expression}where expression consists of all characters until the matching\n       \u201c}\u201d.  Any \u201c}\u201d escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string,\n       and characters in embedded arithmetic expansions, command\n       substitutions, and variable expansions, are not examined in\n       determining the matching \u201c}\u201d.\n\n       The simplest form for parameter expansion is:${parameter}The value, if any, of parameter is substituted.\n\n       The parameter name or symbol can be enclosed in braces, which are\n       optional except for positional parameters with more than one\n       digit or when parameter is followed by a character that could be\n       interpreted as part of the name.  If a parameter expansion occurs\n       inside double-quotes:\n\n       1.   Pathname expansion is not performed on the results of the\n            expansion.\n\n       2.   Field splitting is not performed on the results of the\n            expansion, with the exception of @.\n\n       In addition, a parameter expansion can be modified by using one\n       of the following formats.\n\n       ${parameter:-word}    Use Default Values.  If parameter is unset\n                             or null, the expansion of word is\n                             substituted; otherwise, the value of\n                             parameter is substituted.\n\n       ${parameter:=word}    Assign Default Values.  If parameter is\n                             unset or null, the expansion of word is\n                             assigned to parameter.  In all cases, the\n                             final value of parameter is substituted.\n                             Only variables, not positional parameters\n                             or special parameters, can be assigned in\n                             this way.\n\n       ${parameter:?[word]}  Indicate Error if Null or Unset.  If\n                             parameter is unset or null, the expansion\n                             of word (or a message indicating it is\n                             unset if word is omitted) is written to\n                             standard error and the shell exits with a\n                             nonzero exit status.  Otherwise, the value\n                             of parameter is substituted.  An\n                             interactive shell need not exit.\n\n       ${parameter:+word}    Use Alternative Value.  If parameter is\n                             unset or null, null is substituted;\n                             otherwise, the expansion of word is\n                             substituted.\n\n       In the parameter expansions shown previously, use of the colon in\n       the format results in a test for a parameter that is unset or\n       null; omission of the colon results in a test for a parameter\n       that is only unset.\n\n       ${#parameter}         String Length.  The length in characters of\n                             the value of parameter.\n\n       The following four varieties of parameter expansion provide for\n       substring processing.  In each case, pattern matching notation\n       (see \u201cShell Patterns\u201d), rather than regular expression notation,\n       is used to evaluate the patterns.  If parameter is * or @, the\n       result of the expansion is unspecified.  Enclosing the full\n       parameter expansion string in double-quotes does not cause the\n       following four varieties of pattern characters to be quoted,\n       whereas quoting characters within the braces has this effect.\n\n       ${parameter%word}     Remove Smallest Suffix Pattern.  The word\n                             is expanded to produce a pattern.  The\n                             parameter expansion then results in\n                             parameter, with the smallest portion of the\n                             suffix matched by the pattern deleted.\n\n       ${parameter%%word}    Remove Largest Suffix Pattern.  The word is\n                             expanded to produce a pattern.  The\n                             parameter expansion then results in\n                             parameter, with the largest portion of the\n                             suffix matched by the pattern deleted.\n\n       ${parameter#word}     Remove Smallest Prefix Pattern.  The word\n                             is expanded to produce a pattern.  The\n                             parameter expansion then results in\n                             parameter, with the smallest portion of the\n                             prefix matched by the pattern deleted.\n\n       ${parameter##word}    Remove Largest Prefix Pattern.  The word is\n                             expanded to produce a pattern.  The\n                             parameter expansion then results in\n                             parameter, with the largest portion of the\n                             prefix matched by the pattern deleted.Command SubstitutionCommand substitution allows the output of a command to be\n       substituted in place of the command name itself.  Command\n       substitution occurs when the command is enclosed as follows:$(command)or (\u201cbackquoted\u201d version):`command`The shell expands the command substitution by executing command\n       in a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution\n       with the standard output of the command, removing sequences of\n       one or more \u27e8newline\u27e9s at the end of the substitution.  (Embedded\n       \u27e8newline\u27e9s before the end of the output are not removed; however,\n       during field splitting, they may be translated into \u27e8space\u27e9s,\n       depending on the value of IFS and quoting that is in effect.)Arithmetic ExpansionArithmetic expansion provides a mechanism for evaluating an\n       arithmetic expression and substituting its value.  The format for\n       arithmetic expansion is as follows:$((expression))The expression is treated as if it were in double-quotes, except\n       that a double-quote inside the expression is not treated\n       specially.  The shell expands all tokens in the expression for\n       parameter expansion, command substitution, and quote removal.\n\n       Next, the shell treats this as an arithmetic expression and\n       substitutes the value of the expression.White Space Splitting (Field Splitting)After parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic\n       expansion the shell scans the results of expansions and\n       substitutions that did not occur in double-quotes for field\n       splitting and multiple fields can result.\n\n       The shell treats each character of the IFS as a delimiter and\n       uses the delimiters to split the results of parameter expansion\n       and command substitution into fields.\n\n       If IFS is empty, field splitting yields no fields if the input\n       string was empty, and one string with the unchanged value of the\n       input otherwise.  For example, with the default IFS, \u201cread -rl\u201d\n       will remove any initial whitespace, but \u201cIFS=read -rl\u201d will\n       leave the entire line in l.Pathname Expansion (File Name Generation)Unless the-fflag is set, file name generation is performed\n       after word splitting is complete.  Each word is viewed as a\n       series of patterns, separated by slashes.  The process of\n       expansion replaces the word with the names of all existing files\n       whose names can be formed by replacing each pattern with a string\n       that matches the specified pattern.  There are two restrictions\n       on this: first, a pattern cannot match a string containing a\n       slash, and second, a pattern cannot match a string starting with\n       a period unless the first character of the pattern is a period.\n       The next section describes the patterns used for both Pathname\n       Expansion and thecasecommand.Shell PatternsA pattern consists of normal characters, which match themselves,\n       and meta-characters.  The meta-characters are \u201c!\u201d, \u201c*\u201d, \u201c?\u201d, and\n       \u201c[\u201d.  These characters lose their special meanings if they are\n       quoted.  When command or variable substitution is performed and\n       the dollar sign or back quotes are not double quoted, the value\n       of the variable or the output of the command is scanned for these\n       characters and they are turned into meta-characters.\n\n       An asterisk (\u201c*\u201d) matches any string of characters.  A question\n       mark matches any single character.  A left bracket (\u201c[\u201d)\n       introduces a character class.  The end of the character class is\n       indicated by a (\u201c]\u201d); if the \u201c]\u201d is missing then the \u201c[\u201d matches\n       a \u201c[\u201d rather than introducing a character class.  A character\n       class matches any of the characters between the square brackets.\n       A range of characters may be specified using a minus sign.  The\n       character class may be complemented by making an exclamation\n       point the first character of the character class.\n\n       To include a \u201c]\u201d in a character class, make it the first\n       character listed (after the \u201c!\u201d, if any).  To include a minus\n       sign, make it the first or last character listed.BuiltinsThis section lists the builtin commands which are builtin because\n       they need to perform some operation that can't be performed by a\n       separate process.  In addition to these, there are several other\n       commands that may be builtin for efficiency (e.g.printf(1),echo(1),test(1), etc).\n\n       :\n\n       true   A null command that returns a 0 (true) exit value.\n\n       false  A null command that returns a 1 (false) exit value.\n\n       . file\n              The commands in the specified file are read and executed\n              by the shell.\n\n       alias [name[=string ...]]\n              Ifname=stringis specified, the shell defines the aliasnamewith valuestring.  If justnameis specified, the\n              value of the aliasnameis printed.  With no arguments,\n              thealiasbuiltin prints the names and values of all\n              defined aliases (seeunalias).\n\n       bg [job]...Continue the specified jobs (or the current job if no jobs\n              are given) in the background.\n\n       command [-p] [-v] [-V]command[arg ...]\n              Execute the specified command but ignore shell functions\n              when searching for it.  (This is useful when you have a\n              shell function with the same name as a builtin command.)-psearch for command using a PATH that guarantees to\n                     find all the standard utilities.-VDo not execute the command but search for the\n                     command and print the resolution of the command\n                     search.  This is the same as the type builtin.-vDo not execute the command but search for the\n                     command and print the absolute pathname of\n                     utilities, the name for builtins or the expansion\n                     of aliases.\n\n       cd|chdir-cd|chdir [-LP] [directory]\n              Switch to the specified directory (default HOME).  If an\n              entry for CDPATH appears in the environment of thecdcommand or the shell variable CDPATH is set and the\n              directory name does not begin with a slash, then the\n              directories listed in CDPATH will be searched for the\n              specified directory.  The format of CDPATH is the same as\n              that of PATH.  If a single dash is specified as the\n              argument, it will be replaced by the value of OLDPWD.  Thecdcommand will print out the name of the directory that\n              it actually switched to if this is different from the name\n              that the user gave.  These may be different either because\n              the CDPATH mechanism was used or because the argument is a\n              single dash.  The-Poption causes the physical directory\n              structure to be used, that is, all symbolic links are\n              resolved to their respective values.  The-Loption turns\n              off the effect of any preceding-Poptions.\n\n       echo [-n]args...Print the arguments on the standard output, separated by\n              spaces.  Unless the-noption is present, a newline is\n              output following the arguments.\n\n              If any of the following sequences of characters is\n              encountered during output, the sequence is not output.\n              Instead, the specified action is performed:\\bA backspace character is output.\\cSubsequent output is suppressed.  This is normally\n                      used at the end of the last argument to suppress\n                      the trailing newline thatechowould otherwise\n                      output.\\fOutput a form feed.\\nOutput a newline character.\\rOutput a carriage return.\\tOutput a (horizontal) tab character.\\vOutput a vertical tab.\\0digitsOutput the character whose value is given by zero\n                      to three octal digits.  If there are zero digits,\n                      a nul character is output.\\\\Output a backslash.\n\n              All other backslash sequences elicit undefined behaviour.\n\n       evalstring ...Concatenate all the arguments with spaces.  Then re-parse\n              and execute the command.\n\n       exec [command arg ...]\n              Unless command is omitted, the shell process is replaced\n              with the specified program (which must be a real program,\n              not a shell builtin or function).  Any redirections on theexeccommand are marked as permanent, so that they are not\n              undone when theexeccommand finishes.\n\n       exit [exitstatus]\n              Terminate the shell process.  Ifexitstatusis given it is\n              used as the exit status of the shell; otherwise the exit\n              status of the preceding command is used.\n\n       exportname ...export-pThe specified names are exported so that they will appear\n              in the environment of subsequent commands.  The only way\n              to un-export a variable is to unset it.  The shell allows\n              the value of a variable to be set at the same time it is\n              exported by writingexport name=valueWith no arguments the export command lists the names of\n              all exported variables.  With the-poption specified the\n              output will be formatted suitably for non-interactive use.\n\n       fc [-eeditor] [first[last]]\n\n       fc-l[-nr] [first[last]]\n\n       fc-s[old=new] [first]\n              Thefcbuiltin lists, or edits and re-executes, commands\n              previously entered to an interactive shell.-eeditor\n                     Use the editor named by editor to edit the\n                     commands.  The editor string is a command name,\n                     subject to search via the PATH variable.  The value\n                     in the FCEDIT variable is used as a default when-eis not specified.  If FCEDIT is null or unset, the\n                     value of the EDITOR variable is used.  If EDITOR is\n                     null or unset,ed(1) is used as the editor.-l(ell)\n                     List the commands rather than invoking an editor on\n                     them.  The commands are written in the sequence\n                     indicated by the first and last operands, as\n                     affected by-r, with each command preceded by the\n                     command number.-nSuppress command numbers when listing with -l.-rReverse the order of the commands listed (with-l)\n                     or edited (with neither-lnor-s).-sRe-execute the command without invoking an editor.\n\n              first\n\n              last   Select the commands to list or edit.  The number of\n                     previous commands that can be accessed are\n                     determined by the value of the HISTSIZE variable.\n                     The value of first or last or both are one of the\n                     following:\n\n                     [+]number\n                            A positive number representing a command\n                            number; command numbers can be displayed\n                            with the-loption.-numberA negative decimal number representing the\n                            command that was executed number of commands\n                            previously.

If the\n                     old=new operand is not also specified with-s, the\n                     string form of the first operand cannot contain an\n                     embedded equal sign.\n\n              The following environment variables affect the execution\n              of fc:\n\n              FCEDIT    Name of the editor to use.\n\n              HISTSIZE  The number of previous commands that are\n                        accessible.\n\n       fg [job]\n              Move the specified job or the current job to the\n              foreground.\n\n       getoptsoptstring var[arg ...]\n              The POSIXgetoptscommand, not to be confused with theBell Labs-derivedgetopt(1).\n\n              The first argument should be a series of letters, each of\n              which may be optionally followed by a colon to indicate\n              that the option requires an argument.  The variable\n              specified is set to the parsed option.\n\n              Thegetoptscommand deprecates the oldergetopt(1) utility\n              due to its handling of arguments containing whitespace.\n\n              Thegetoptsbuiltin may be used to obtain options and\n              their arguments from a list of parameters.  When invoked,getoptsplaces the value of the next option from the\n              option string in the list in the shell variable specified\n              byvarand its index in the shell variable OPTIND.  When\n              the shell is invoked, OPTIND is initialized to 1.  For\n              each option that requires an argument, thegetoptsbuiltin\n              will place it in the shell variable OPTARG.  If an option\n              is not allowed for in theoptstring, then OPTARG will be\n              unset.\n\n              By default, the variables$1,...,$nare inspected; ifargs are specified, they'll be parsed instead.optstringis a string of recognized option letters (seegetopt(3)).  If a letter is followed by a colon, the\n              option is expected to have an argument which may or may\n              not be separated from it by white space.  If an option\n              character is not found where expected,getoptswill set\n              the variablevarto a \u201c?\u201d;getoptswill then unset OPTARG\n              and write output to standard error.  By specifying a colon\n              as the first character ofoptstringall errors will be\n              ignored.\n\n              After the last optiongetoptswill return a non-zero value\n              and setvarto \u201c?\u201d.\n\n              The following code fragment shows how one might process\n              the arguments for a command that can take the options [a]\n              and [b], and the option [c], which requires an argument.\n\n                    while getopts abc: f\n                    do\n                            case $f in\n                            a | b)  flag=$f;;\n                            c)      carg=$OPTARG;;\n                            \\?)     echo $USAGE; exit 1;;\n                            esac\n                    done\n                    shift $((OPTIND - 1))\n\n              This code will accept any of the following as equivalent:\n\n                    cmd -acarg file file\n                    cmd -a -c arg file file\n                    cmd -carg -a file file\n                    cmd -a -carg -- file file\n\n       hash [command ...]\n\n       hash-rThe shell maintains a hash table which remembers the\n              locations of commands.  With no arguments whatsoever, thehashcommand prints out the contents of this table.\n              Entries which have not been looked at since the lastcdcommand are marked with an asterisk; it is possible for\n              these entries to be invalid.\n\n              With arguments, thehashcommand removes the specified\n              commands from the hash table (unless they are functions)\n              and then locates them.

The command \u2018set -o vi\u2019 enables vi-mode\n       editing and places sh into vi insert mode.  With vi-mode enabled,\n       sh can be switched between insert mode and command mode.  It is\n       similar to vi: typing \u27e8ESC\u27e9 enters vi command mode.  Hitting\n       \u27e8return\u27e9 while in command mode will pass the line to the shell.",

Programs\n       using these fields may need to adjust the capitalization if the\n       output is going to be used at the beginning of a sentence.\n\n       The date string formatting capabilities are intended for use in\n       Gregorian-style calendars, possibly with a different starting\n       year (or years). The%xand%cconversion specifications,\n       however, are intended for local representation; these may be\n       based on a different, non-Gregorian calendar.\n\n       The%Cconversion specification was introduced to allow a\n       fallback for the%EC(alternative year format base year); it can\n       be viewed as the base of the current subdivision in the Gregorian\n       calendar. The century number is calculated as the year divided by\n       100 and truncated to an integer; it should not be confused with\n       the use of ordinal numbers for centuries (for example, ``twenty-\n       first century''.) Both the%Eyand%ycan then be viewed as the\n       offset from%ECand%C, respectively.\n\n       TheEandOmodifiers modify the traditional conversion\n       specifiers, so that they can always be used, even if the\n       implementation (or the current locale) does not support the\n       modifier.\n\n       TheEmodifier supports alternative date formats, such as the\n       Japanese Emperor's Era, as long as these are based on the\n       Gregorian calendar system. Extending theEmodifiers to other\n       date elements may provide an implementation-defined extension\n       capable of supporting other calendar systems, especially in\n       combination with theOmodifier.\n\n       TheOmodifier supports time and date formats using the locale's\n       alternative numerical symbols, such as Kanji or Hindi digits or\n       ordinal number representation.\n\n       Non-European locales, whether they use Latin digits in\n       computational items or not, often have local forms of the digits\n       for use in date formats. This is not totally unknown even in\n       Europe; a variant of dates uses Roman numerals for the months:\n       the third day of September 1991 would be written as 3.IX.1991. In\n       Japan, Kanji digits are regularly used for dates; in Arabic-\n       speaking countries, Hindi digits are used.  The%d,%e,%H,%I,%m,%S,%U,%w,%W, and%yconversion specifications always\n       return the date and time field in Latin digits (that is, 0 to 9).\n       The%Omodifier was introduced to support the use for display\n       purposes of non-Latin digits. In theLC_TIMEcategory inlocaledef, the optionalalt_digitskeyword is intended for this\n       purpose. As an example, assume the following (partial)localedefsource:\n\n           alt_digits  \"\";\"I\";\"II\";\"III\";\"IV\";\"V\";\"VI\";\"VII\";\"VIII\" \\\n                       \"IX\";\"X\";\"XI\";\"XII\"\n           d_fmt       \"%e.%Om.%Y\"\n\n       With the above date, the command:\n\n           date \"+%x\"\n\n       would yield 3.IX.1991. With the samed_fmt, but without thealt_digits, the command would yield 3.9.1991.",
